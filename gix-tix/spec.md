# gix-tix specification

This document describes the intended behavior of `tix` on this branch. It is the
behavioral contract for future changes; implementation details belong here only
when they preserve responsiveness, bounded memory, Git compatibility, or resource
lifetime.

## Purpose and invocation

`tix` is a minimal, `tig`-inspired commit-history browser optimized for large
repositories. It must remain useful on histories as large as the Linux kernel
without trading responsiveness for metadata that is not visible.

- `tix [REVISION]...` shows commits reachable from the supplied revisions, or
  from `HEAD` when none are supplied.
- Standalone `tix` accepts `-t|--trace` up to four times. One occurrence emits
  forest-formatted info events, two emit forest-formatted debug events, three
  emit flat debug events, and four emit flat trace events. `gix tix` inherits
  the same option from `gix` instead of repeating it after the subcommand.
  Traces are buffered independently of progress and printed to stderr after the
  command and any terminal UI teardown. Forest output uses `gix-trace`, keeps
  worker spans and events in their spawning tracing tree, and retains the latest
  values of fields recorded after a span starts. Flat output includes completed spans.
  Explicit trace setup precedes standalone repository discovery, reports setup
  failure, and emits a start event even for non-interactive commands.
  History-view options cannot be combined with a subcommand; use `--` before a
  revision whose name is also a command.
- `tix worktrunk`, its visible `tix wt` alias, and `tix worktrunk switch`
  open an existing-worktree picker above a fully interactive Tix history. The
  list occupies no more than half the terminal, with its status/search line
  below it as a separator from the history. Moving its cursor immediately paints
  the new selection without changing repository state and requests its history
  preview. If that preview is not ready, the previous history remains
  visible, marked loading, and read-only; completion activates only the latest
  selection. Each activation refreshes its tree and worktree-change diffs.
  `PageUp` and `PageDown` move by the visible list height. `/` opens a
  case-insensitive fuzzy search over worktree names; edits and navigation paint
  and preview the current match, `Ctrl-P` and `Ctrl-N` move up and down, `Enter`
  selects it immediately, and `Escape` cancels the search and restores its
  starting selection.
  `Tab` focuses history and `Escape` returns from root history to the list.
  `Enter` selects the worktree and exits the picker. Selection hands its path
  to the shell wrapper, or prints it on stdout without shell integration, just
  like an explicit switch target. It does not open another history session.
  `d` twice removes a clean selected linked worktree; `D` twice removes it while
  discarding changes. A different key cancels the confirmation, and `Escape`
  cancels it without closing the picker. The launch and main worktrees cannot be
  removed, and locked worktrees direct the user to the CLI's double-force form.
  Removal uses the sole background-task slot, reports phased progress, and
  immediately selects and previews the surviving row at the same index (or the
  previous final row). A safe removal also deletes its logical local branch when
  exactly one inferred local default exists and the observed branch tip is
  already its ancestor. A concurrent branch move retains the branch and warns;
  configuration cleanup failure warns that the branch was removed but its
  configuration remains.
  Compact `Worktree`, `Status`, `Base ±`, and `Commits ↕` columns distinguish
  the launch, main, and linked worktrees and stream their dirty state, upstream
  ahead/behind counts, and additions and removals against the unambiguous
  inferred hidden base. Additions and ahead counts are green; removals and behind
  counts are light red, while a selected row retains its cyan background. The
  list omits redundant branch and absolute-path columns. Space pressure removes
  the left side of worktree names first while retaining an ellipsis and suffix.
  Detached worktrees use
  their symbolic `refs/worktree/tix/pins/HEAD` branch when present. Without a
  configured upstream, ahead/behind is omitted unless exactly one hidden tip
  identifies the comparison history.
- `tix worktrunk show` prints that table without opening a terminal UI. It waits
  for every worktree's dirty state, ahead/behind relation, and base diffstat,
  then writes every row without colors, selection, or name truncation.
- `tix worktrunk switch TARGET [--path PATH]` and `tix worktrunk switch
  --new-branch NAME [--path PATH]` select without opening the picker. `TARGET`
  is an exact existing worktree path or local branch; an unchecked-out branch
  gets a linked worktree at `PATH`, or beside the main worktree as
  `<repository>.<branch>` with slashes replaced by dashes. Remote-tracking
  branches are never inferred. `--new-branch` creates a missing local branch at
  the logical Tix HEAD, while reusing it unchanged if it already exists.
  Creation returns the canonical path recorded by Git so later selection of the
  same worktree is stable.
- `tix worktrunk switch --detach [COMMIT] [--path PATH]` creates a new linked
  worktree with a detached `HEAD`. `-d` is the short form of `--detach`, and it
  cannot be combined with `--new-branch`. `COMMIT` accepts a full or abbreviated
  commit hash or another Git revision resolving to a commit. Omitting it uses
  the source's actual `HEAD`, even when a symbolic Tix HEAD pin remembers a
  branch at a different commit. The new worktree starts with that commit's
  checked-out tree and index. Without `--path`, the destination is beside the
  main worktree as `<repository>.<seven-digit-commit-hash>`; occupied paths gain
  `-2`, `-3`, and so on, so repeated invocations create separate worktrees.
  Successful creation hands off or prints the canonical destination just like
  branch-based creation. Invalid or non-commit targets and an unborn default
  `HEAD` fail before creating a worktree.
  Creation from a source worktree creates or reuses an ordinary symbolic pin
  there targeting `worktrees/<new-worktree-id>/HEAD`, whether attached or detached
  and regardless of existing pins.
  The pin follows later commits and checkouts in the new worktree, including
  changes made outside Tix, and brings that tip into the source's history.
  The new worktree and bare source repositories receive no pins.
  The relationship consists solely of this pin;
  there is no separate parent/offspring metadata. A failure to create the
  worktree adds no pin; a later pinning failure reports the already-created
  worktree's path.
- `tix worktrunk remove [TARGET] [-f...] [-D|--force-delete]` removes a linked
  worktree with Git's force levels: no `-f` protects changes and submodules, one
  `-f` discards them, and two or more also override a lock. An omitted target
  selects the current linked worktree. It safely deletes an associated
  non-default branch only when it is merged into the one inferred local default;
  `--force-delete` skips the mergedness check but still retains the inferred
  default branch. Branch cleanup failure is a warning after successful worktree
  removal and distinguishes a retained branch from a removed branch whose
  configuration remains. Success hands the shell to the main worktree, or to the
  parent of the common Git directory when no main worktree exists; without shell
  integration that destination is printed on stdout. If removal of the current
  worktree fails after deletion starts, the shell still moves there while
  preserving the failure status.
- `tix worktrunk shell-init SHELL` prints a `wt` wrapper for Bash, Zsh, Fish,
  Nushell, or PowerShell. The wrapper lets a successful selection change the
  calling shell's directory and returns to its prompt, allowing the shell's
  terminal CWD integration to run before the user opens Tix again. Setup output
  never edits shell profiles. `gix tix` emits a wrapper
  which consistently invokes `gix tix` instead. Handoff rejects non-Unicode
  worktree paths rather than passing a corrupted path to the shell.
- `tix show [-x HIDDEN...] [--no-auto-hide] [TIP...]`, also available through
  the visible `tix status` alias, prints the complete
  history view without opening a terminal UI. Tips default to `HEAD`, and
  applicable pins participate exactly as they do in the history view. Output
  uses the history view's graph lanes and default metadata, without colors,
  selection, clipping, or a footer. The current `HEAD` uses the history view's
  `@` node even when detached; a base separator places it after `base`. Each visible
  root replaces its ordinary row
  with a centered `──── base <metadata> ────` separator; distinct roots therefore
  delineate their trees while retaining the commit's markers and metadata. Each
  seven-character commit hash is followed by its seven-character reverse-hex
  change ID. Colliding or duplicated prefixes remain visible and receive a `💥`
  gutter marker.
- `tix travel [--stash] [--materialize-conflicts] (REVSPEC | --to first|parent|child|tip)`
  performs the same detached checkout, pending-rebase replay, stash handling,
  and pin reconciliation as TUI time travel. Plain travel carries local changes;
  `--stash` saves them at the departure commit before travelling and restores
  them on return. Automatic review-boundary stashing applies in both modes.
  Its target may also be an unambiguous reverse-hex change-ID prefix from the
  default Tix view. `parent` and `child` move one edge from `HEAD`; `first` selects its oldest reachable
  root and `tip` its reachable leaf, considering only commits visible in the
  default view. Multiple direct or terminal candidates are reported with their
  commit and change IDs and must be selected with a direct `tix travel REVSPEC`.
  Travelling to the current `HEAD` is a no-op.
  A detached source may travel to a descendant without a pin, but travelling to
  an ancestor or unrelated commit requires an existing current-worktree pin at
  `HEAD` or a descendant. An attached source is preserved through the singleton
  HEAD-pin rules. A conflicting replay is published only when explicitly
  materialized; earlier completed replay steps retain their updates.
  An accepted conflict writes the checkout and unmerged index,
  then exits with an error so resolution cannot be mistaken for completion.
- `tix stash` saves the index and worktree state in a gix stash associated with
  the `HEAD` commit through the same commit-stash operation as the TUI.
- `tix transplant ROOT [--leaf TIP ... | --subtree] (--copy | --move)
  (--fork | --insert) (--above DEST | --below DEST)
  [--materialize-conflicts[=CONTINUE]]` applies the same tree selection and
  transplant rules as the TUI. Root alone selects one commit; repeated leaves
  select inclusive root-to-leaf paths, and `--subtree` selects every eligible
  descendant. Overlapping paths and duplicate leaves are normalized. Operands
  accept Git revisions or unambiguous reverse-hex change-ID prefixes from the
  default Tix view. The copy/move, fork/insert, and placement choices are required.
  Success prints the transplanted root's commit/change IDs followed by reference
  rewrites. A conflict changes nothing unless explicitly materialized into the
  existing editable rebase continuation workflow.
- `tix admin clear-undo` atomically and idempotently deletes the current
  worktree's undo and redo queue. It does not apply or reverse queued operations,
  change their recorded references, or affect another worktree's queue.
- `tix enrich commit todo [--clear] [REVSPEC]`, `tix enrich commit note
  [REVSPEC] [-m MESSAGE ... | -f FILE]`, `tix enrich commit git-note
  [REVSPEC] [-m MESSAGE ... | -f FILE]`, `tix enrich tree
  checks-pass [--clear] [REVSPEC]`, and `tix enrich patch refackiewed [--clear]
  [REVSPEC]` expose the TUI's enrichment actions without opening it.
  Targets default to `HEAD` and accept Git revisions or unambiguous
  reverse-hex change-ID prefixes from the default Tix view. Boolean commands
  idempotently set their marker, or clear it with `--clear`. Note commands use
  Git's editor by default. Like `tix reword`, repeated `-m/--message` values form
  paragraphs and `-f/--file` reads a complete message from a file, or standard
  input with `-`. Explicit input replaces the note without opening an editor;
  for example, agents can use `tix enrich commit note "$fixup_change" --file "$note_file"`.
  Both input paths use the existing whitespace cleanup, preserve comment-looking
  lines and other enrichments, remove empty notes, and leave unchanged notes and
  undo history alone. Output
  starts with the target's abbreviated commit and change IDs before its status.
  The patch command writes its status to stderr. Marking a legacy patch can
  rewrite its commit to add the identity described below; the status then
  identifies the rewritten commit.
- `tix new [--index | --worktree | --worktree-untracked] [--allow-empty] [--todo]
  [--author "Name <email>"] [-m MESSAGE ... | -f FILE]` creates a child of `HEAD`, or a root commit for
  unborn `HEAD`, with the same signing, editor, enrichment, lazy-rebase, and
  worktree-safety rules as `a w`. By default a changed index wins and tracked
  worktree changes are used only when the index is unchanged. `--index` uses
  only the index delta; `--worktree` applies only unstaged tracked-worktree
  changes to the `HEAD` tree and omits staged-only changes. `--worktree-untracked`
  additionally includes non-ignored untracked files. An unchanged selected tree
  is rejected unless `--allow-empty` is given. Message files,
  repeated messages, standard input, editor bypass, and `--author` follow
  `tix reword`; the author uses the prepared new-commit date. `--todo` enables
  the new commit's editable Todo header.
- `tix reword REVSPEC [--author "Name <email>"] [-m MESSAGE ... | -f FILE]`
  applies the same signing,
  lazy-rebase, mutable-ref, and worktree-safety rules as the TUI. Without either
  message option it opens the standard Markdown reword document. Repeated
  `-m/--message` values form paragraphs; `-f/--file` reads the complete message
  from a file, or from standard input when given `-`. Explicit sources bypass
  the editor and do not add suggested trailers. `--author` replaces the author
  actor while preserving its date. Without an explicit message it prefills the
  normal editor document; with one it is applied non-interactively. An attached
  `HEAD` may reword itself without a pin. Every other target requires an existing
  current-worktree tix pin at that commit or a descendant. As with `tix travel`,
  an unambiguous default-view change-ID prefix may replace the Git revspec;
  every such covering pin participates so retained forks are rewritten together.
  Eligibility is checked before the editor opens, and an unchanged document is
  an explicit no-op. Editor documents also contain commented `Todo` and
  `Message:` enrichment headers. An uncommented bare `Todo` enables the flag;
  commenting or deleting it disables the flag. `Message:` accepts one title
  line. Editing that title preserves an existing message body byte-for-byte,
  while commenting, deleting, or emptying the header removes the whole message.
  Explicit `-m` and `-f` messages preserve enrichments.
- Primary command output follows every displayed abbreviated commit hash with
  its reverse-hex change ID. The two abbreviations have equal widths. This
  applies to mutation results, rewritten-ref mappings, pins, stash and travel
  notices, raw commit labels in `ref-tree`, and visible commit identifiers in
  rebase todos. Diagnostics on stderr and the full object IDs in the hidden
  `tix-rebase-state-v3` block remain unchanged.
- `-x/--hide REVSPEC` excludes the revision and its reachable ancestry. The
  option may be repeated.
- `-h/--help` prints Clap's standard help for `tix` and every subcommand.
- Diagnostics retain underlying causes when adding command or argument context,
  including encoding failures when OS-string conversions fail.
- `--quit-on-finish[=INPUTS]` exits after traversal, lane computation, and one
  completed frame, for measurement and non-interactive inspection. Optional
  characters are replayed as read-only keyboard input before the retained final
  frame, allowing navigation such as `--quit-on-finish=jjjl`. Inputs that would
  mutate the repository, launch another program, or copy data are ignored. The
  frame is drawn on the normal screen and remains visible after exit. It may be
  combined with the target-less worktrunk picker forms; there inputs use the
  picker bindings and wait for each selected preview, and the final frame waits
  for every worktree's status and graph metadata.
- `--no-alt-screen` runs the interactive UI in a full-height inline viewport on
  the normal screen for debugging only, retaining its frame and panic output.
  Use `tix show` for one-off queries. Input handling otherwise matches the
  default interactive mode.
- `tix rebase todo [-x HIDDEN...] [--no-auto-hide]
  [--onto REV | --update-base] [TIP...]`
  writes a self-contained Markdown history-rebase plan to stdout. Visible tips
  default to `HEAD`, and an ambiguous derived fork point is an error. With
  `--update-base`, the uniquely derived fork point is rebased onto the same newer
  hidden local branch tip offered by TUI `rebase-update`; absence of such a tip
  is an error. The resulting `(updated-base)` plan remains actionable when saved
  unchanged. `--update-base` and an explicit `--onto` are mutually exclusive.
  `--edit-and-apply` opens the same plan with Git's configured editor and applies
  it when the editor exits. It also accepts `--materialize-conflicts [CONTINUE]`
  to opt into the same conflict checkout and continuation-document workflow as
  `tix rebase apply`; the option requires `--edit-and-apply`.
- `tix show`, `tix ref-tree`, and `tix rebase todo` automatically inspect symbolic
  `refs/remotes/<remote>/HEAD` references. Their targets are reverse-mapped
  through each remote's fetch refspec, and existing local commit branches are
  added to the explicit hidden revisions. Multiple remote defaults are
  deduplicated; stale, direct, ambiguous, unmappable, missing, and non-commit
  results are ignored. At least one explicit or inferred hidden revision is
  required by commands that need a hidden boundary. `--no-auto-hide` disables
  inference. A directly launched interactive history applies explicit `-x`
  filters immediately. Without `-x`, it starts with full history and makes the
  same inferred local defaults available to `Shift-H` / `v h`; the first toggle
  hides their reachable commits. Explicit filters are not broadened by inference,
  and invalid explicit filters do not fall back to inferred ones. Worktrunk
  previews start with inferred exclusions applied.
- `tix rebase apply [FILE]` applies such a plan from a file, or from standard
  input when `FILE` is omitted or `-`. Removing its state comment or emptying the
  document cancels successfully; malformed or unsupported state is an error.
- By default, a todo conflict changes nothing. Explicit
  `--materialize-conflicts [CONTINUE]` accepts the partial result, checks out the
  conflicting commit with an unmerged index, and writes a fresh editable
  continuation todo to `CONTINUE`, or stdout when `-` is used. A terminal stdout
  is refused. Materialization exits unsuccessfully so scripts cannot mistake the
  incomplete rebase for completion.
- Editor-launching commands honor Git's normal editor selection and
  `GIT_EDITOR` overrides it.
- Revisions must resolve and peel to commits. Invalid or non-commit visible
  revisions are errors. An unavailable hidden revision emits a warning and is
  ignored when another hidden revision resolves; if none resolve, startup fails.
- References that disappear during enumeration are ignored. Other errors while
  reading references are reported.
- The interactive UI owns the alternate screen by default. `--no-alt-screen`
  instead draws interactively on the normal screen for debugging; `tix show` is
  the non-interactive command for one-off queries. Raw mode, focus reporting,
  mouse capture, and enhanced keyboard reporting are restored on every exit path.
  Shutdown leaves the alternate screen without clearing it or writing afterward.
  `--quit-on-finish` draws without input reporting on the normal screen.
- `Ctrl-C` exits immediately from any normal tix focus without recovery
  bookkeeping. `q` quits from history, including while a conflict or rebase
  continuation is suspended, except while a user background task is running;
  then it reports that Ctrl-C is required to force exit. Before a normal exit,
  tix journals already-materialized reference progress and drops only in-memory
  candidates; it never rolls repository state back. `q` or `Escape` in a focused
  changes block still returns focus to history.

## History model

### Traversal and projection

- Traversal streams commits before graph-lane computation finishes. The footer
  reports the number received while loading and switches to the selected row
  number after completion. Every visible root starts at `#0`; descendants use
  their on-screen row distance from that root. A merge reachable from multiple
  visible roots uses the visually closest root, so only one count is shown.
- Commit topology, commit time, and generation are loaded through the same
  commit-graph-or-ODB lookup model as `gix-traverse`. A small object cache avoids
  repeated ODB decoding during a walk.
- Metadata already decoded from ODB is retained. Metadata omitted because a
  commit came from the commit-graph is populated lazily for visible rows.
- The persistent graph is append-only and index-addressed, with one compact copy
  of each commit and flat parent edges. View refreshes project rows from this
  cache and stop walking when complete cached ancestry is reached.
- One persistent graph is shared by every worktrunk preview. Resolving another
  worktree adds only missing ancestry for its visible and hidden tips; selection
  switches the active rev-set without rebuilding or rewalking cached topology.
  Worktree ahead/behind and comparison-base discovery use this graph rather than
  independent ancestry walks. The picker extends the graph for all worktree heads
  in one background metadata pass before idle preview warming, so table completion
  neither serializes one graph refresh per row nor blocks terminal input.
- Local branch targets are reverse-indexed. Configured upstream targets are added
  as internal traversal tips so ahead/behind calculations have complete ancestry
  without a second repository walk.
- Shallow boundaries are honored. Parent topology needed by future projections,
  hidden expansion, and ahead/behind calculations must not be pruned with the
  currently visible lane graph.

### Hidden history

- Hidden ancestry is removed from the selectable view by default. Direct parents
  that connect visible history to hidden history remain as boundary rows. Hidden
  view tips, including pins, reveal their hidden commits down to those shared
  bases, using the same boundary styling and read-only behavior. Older shared
  ancestry stays hidden. The projection follows the current view tips, including
  after restarting Tix; unpinning hides any rows no remaining tip needs. With no
  visible stack, only the applicable hidden tips are shown.
- Boundary rows retain graph styling but use terminal-default colors, are dimmed,
  and can be selected, paged to, restored as a selection, copied, and inspected.
  They cannot be reworded, deleted, or signature-verified. During review-base
  selection, only an eligible base boundary remains selectable among hidden rows.
  They may be used for time travel or as the anchor of an independent transplant.
  A boundary offers the
  history-rebase editor, including when those descendants fork into multiple
  linear stacks.
- If a boundary has exactly one leaf among its visible descendants, selecting it
  uses the boundary-to-leaf tree comparison for the changes block and selection
  diff-stat. Forks which merge back into one leaf qualify; multiple surviving
  leaves retain the boundary commit's ordinary parent diff. Enter opens the same
  complete branch diff, labelled `<base>..<leaf>`.
- Hidden revisions do not change the default reference display mode.
- `Shift-H`, or `v` then `h`, toggles the full hidden projection using explicit
  exclusions, or inferred integration branches when no exclusions were given.
  The direct shortcut works from history and focused changes panes, including while a
  shortcut group is open. An open command popup consumes it as query text.
  Toggling preserves the selected commit when it still exists and otherwise
  selects the newest selectable row.
- When a hidden revspec names a local branch, its best common base with the
  visible tips permanently shows `⇣N` after the commit title when that branch has
  `N` commits not reachable from the view. The terminal edge pushes the marker
  left over a clipped title when necessary. A blank margin remains on each side.
  The cached history graph supplies the base and count; unrelated refs and
  zero-count relations add no marker. If multiple hidden branches share a base,
  the largest count is shown and its tip is retained as the update target; equal
  counts choose a deterministic object ID.

### Row content and visual states

- A row contains graph lanes, a seven-character object ID, optional references,
  author date by default, author and attribution information, markers, and title.
  Simple lane turns use rounded corners in both the TUI and `tix show`; merge
  tees and crossings remain orthogonal so every commit still occupies one row.
- The date's trailing space uses the row's default colors, leaving a one-column
  margin before the author even on selected rows.
- When the current worktree HEAD is in an active review tree, its nearest review
  root and all descendants are drawn before other ready branches. Ambiguous
  unrelated review roots retain the ordinary history order.
- The commit marker is blue when unsigned, orange when signed but unverified or
  being verified, green when verified, and bright red when verification fails.
- The current `HEAD` commit, including a review commit, uses `@` instead of the
  normal commit disc. The marker is italic when HEAD is attached to a branch and
  keeps the same signature and selection coloring. It remains visible when textual
  reference labels are hidden, and textual `HEAD` is never rendered alongside it.
- At startup, the current worktree's `@` row becomes selected as soon as it is
  loaded, unless the user navigates first. Once the viewport is known, the row
  is centered with normal history-boundary clamping so surrounding commits are
  visible. While the row is unselected, its title is shown in reverse video and
  `@` is bold; the selected row's normal inversion replaces that title emphasis
  while keeping `@` bold.
- Branch labels use yellow throughout history, including local, remote-tracking,
  checked-out, and remembered branches. Tags use magenta, with bold text for
  annotated tags.
- Local branches checked out in other worktrees are displayed as `short-name@`.
  The current worktree's symbolic branch is displayed as `@short-name`.
  A detached foreign worktree is shown as `directory@` in light blue at its actual `HEAD`,
  without a pin marker. Its symbolic HEAD pin is shown separately as `★branch`
  at that branch's actual tip. The worktree administration name is used when no
  directory basename is available. A detached current worktree is identified by
  the graph `@` alone and has no redundant `@directory` label. Identical labels
  are deduplicated.
- An unselected commit checked out by any foreign worktree gives only its title
  a dark-gray background, whether that worktree is attached or detached and even
  when reference labels are hidden. The current worktree's reverse-video title
  takes precedence when both point to the same commit; selection clears either
  title emphasis.
- When reference labels are hidden, worktree labels are visible only on the
  selected row. Stale, malformed, unborn, and otherwise unreadable worktree
  entries are skipped without failing history loading.
- The selected row uses `>` at the left. If the displayed worktree block is dirty,
  `🫟` is shown at the `HEAD` row instead; a separately selected row retains `>`.
- A selected row at the current worktree is inverted from its left edge through
  the final displayed title character. Any other selected row is inverted through
  its non-title metadata, leaving the final space and title uninverted. The graph
  background is derived from the commit-marker color. The selected row's
  right-hand tail and contextual information remain separate, have blank margins,
  and never invert an adjacent character.
- A compared merge parent is cyan, including its commit marker, and its hash is
  inverted.
- Rows outside active review-base reachability are dimmed. When a changes block has
  focus, history is dimmed but its contextual selection information and main
  status line remain prominent.

### Metadata and attribution

- Mailmap resolution is enabled by default and is obtained from a non-isolated
  repository.
- Recognized attribution trailers are `Co-authored-by`, `Assisted-by`,
  `Reviewed-by`, `Acked-by`, `Tested-by`, and `Signed-off-by`.
- Every displayed `Assisted-by` value is classified as an agent. Agent names are
  bracketed and agent emails are never displayed.
- Attribution keys with identical displayed actor lists are grouped, for example
  `Co, A: [GPT 5.6]`.
- Actors whose email ends in `@users.noreply.github.com` are italicized.
- Actors matching Git's configured author are bold bright cyan, distinct from
  other actors' regular green. Both identities are resolved through the mailmap
  before comparing names and emails, including when raw names are displayed.
- Full-actor mode shows author emails and attribution actors but hides the commit
  title. Classified agent emails remain hidden.
- A commit message containing `--- agent` or `<!-- agent -->` receives a bright
  purple `[A]` before its title.
- A commit with notes in the configured notes ref receives a matching `[N]`.
  Notes are loaded lazily for visible commits.
- `n g` edits the selected commit's note in `core.notesRef`, or
  `refs/notes/commits` when it is unset. The action is available on every
  selected commit, including immutable hidden boundaries. Empty content removes
  the note and unchanged content is a no-op.
- Every operation that actually rewrites a commit copies its default-ref Git
  note to the successor while retaining the predecessor note. Notes that converge
  through a squash are concatenated in source order with a blank line. A split
  copies the source note only to its rewritten lower identity; inserted and
  dropped commits do not propagate notes. The notes ref changes atomically with
  the other rebase refs and participates in rollback.
- Commit enrichments are stored separately as Git notes headed at the worktree-local
  `refs/worktree/tix/enrich` ref. Enrichments are keyed by the commit's effective
  change ID and use human-readable Git config. Independent `[commit]` keys store
  `todo = true` and an optional multiline `note` value.
  Consequently, rewritten commits retain their metadata and commits sharing a
  change ID share it as well. Malformed enrichments are ignored for display and
  diagnosed, while mutation refuses to overwrite them.
- Tree enrichments use the same human-readable Git config format in notes headed
  at `refs/worktree/tix/enrich-tree`. They are keyed directly by tree object ID;
  `[tree] checks-pass = true` therefore applies to every commit with that exact
  tree and naturally disappears when a rewrite changes the tree.
- Todo, note, checks-pass, and refackiewed enrichments receive leading `🚧`, `📝`,
  `✔️`, and `✨` markers in that order before the graph, with no gap between them
  or the following status field. The dedicated field remains visible alongside
  selection, dirty-worktree, and conflict markers.
  `tix show` emits the same field and aligns unmarked rows when any displayed
  commit has an enrichment. The TUI reserves two cells for each marker so an
  enrichment update never shifts the graph or selection columns.
- Only the selected history row prefixes its commit title with its note title,
  using black text on a yellow background followed by one unstyled space.
  Unselected rows and `tix show` retain only the commit title.
- Commit and selected-note titles render Markdown styling. Block-shaped title
  output is flattened onto the single history row; plain command output retains
  the rendered text without terminal styling.

### Patch identity and enrichment

- A patch identity describes a commit's changes relative to its first parent;
  roots use the empty tree. Merges use their first parent regardless of the
  parent chosen for viewing a diff. Commit messages, actors, timestamps,
  signatures, and unrelated tree content do not identify the patch.
- The identity is stored only in a commit extra header:
  `patch-id v1 <ghij> <base-tree-hex> <result-tree-hex>`. The fingerprint uses the
  repository's object hash algorithm and encodes every hash byte in lowercase
  base four with the alphabet `ghij`: 80 characters for SHA-1 or 128 for SHA-256.
  The two ordinary hexadecimal tree IDs record the
  first-parent and result trees used to calculate it. A conflicted placeholder
  instead carries `patch-id v1 unavailable`.
- Version 1 processes changed leaf entries in byte-path order and includes
  their exact paths, entry modes, and change kind. Renames are conservatively
  represented as a deletion and an addition. Whole-file additions and deletions
  use the content's object ID; mode-only changes need no blob reads. Binary
  changes containing NUL bytes and submodule changes use the old and new object
  IDs, without needing to resolve submodule commits.
- Modified text uses raw repository bytes and a fixed Histogram diff, independent
  of Git diff configuration, attributes, filters, text conversion, or the selected
  UI diff algorithm. Removed and added bytes form separate ordered streams with
  explicit lengths. Line numbers, unchanged context, hunk boundaries, and the
  interleaving of removals with additions are excluded; whitespace, line endings,
  missing final newlines, and each stream's byte order remain significant.
  Moving the same edits through changed context therefore preserves identity
  when those streams stay the same.
- Final commit creation and replay calculate or refresh the header before
  signing. An existing header whose base and result tree IDs still match is
  reused without tree walks, blob reads, or text diffs. Otherwise, matching
  previous and current changed-leaf records allow reuse with updated tree IDs
  and no blob reads; differing records require fingerprinting. Missing old tree objects
  disable this reuse without preventing calculation from the current trees.
  Metadata-only rewrites do not backfill missing identities in legacy commits.
- Lazy rebases retain the old header as stale; they neither calculate a new
  identity nor authorize enrichment. Completed replay refreshes the identity.
  Pending rebases, pending signatures, mismatched tree IDs, and unresolved
  conflicts have no usable patch identity. Unresolved optional AutoMerge inputs
  stay pending and muted while other inputs rebuild; staging a resolution does
  not make their placeholder trees replayable before amend or continuation.
  A malformed or duplicate header is
  diagnosed and ignored for display, and can be replaced when a final rewrite
  refreshes it. Missing or stale identities show no patch enrichment or separate
  stale-identity highlight.
- Patch enrichments are human-readable Git config notes at the worktree-local
  `refs/worktree/tix/enrich-patch` ref, keyed by the effective Tix change ID.
  Each `[patch "v1:<ghij>"]` section stores `refackiewed = true` for that patch
  version. Explicit marking or finishing a review creates approval. The same
  change and patch share it across rewrites, but an unrelated change with the same patch does
  not. Editing a patch hides its old approval; returning to that approved patch
  restores the marker. Updating or clearing one version preserves other
  versions and unknown fields. Malformed notes are diagnosed and ignored for
  display, and mutations refuse to overwrite them. Tree checks remain keyed
  by the exact tree at `refs/worktree/tix/enrich-tree`.
- `n r` toggles refackiewed and is searchable by that name in the command menu.
  With a current header, it changes only the patch notes and is available even
  on immutable boundaries and AutoMerges. Without a header, marking requires
  an ordinary commit eligible for rewording: it calculates the identity and
  rewrites the commit while preserving its author, message, tree, staged
  changes, and worktree bytes. Final descendants remain final under the
  metadata-only rewrite rule. The header, approval, and dependent ref rewrites
  publish atomically and form one undoable operation. Clearing an unmarked legacy
  commit is a no-op. Stale or unavailable identities must complete replay
  before they can be marked or cleared.
- History display, `tix show`, and rebase-todo rendering only validate existing
  headers against commit metadata and read the corresponding notes. They never
  hash patches, diff trees or blobs for identities, write headers or notes, or
  start patch-hashing workers. Legacy commits are not automatically scanned or
  backfilled. Visible-row enrichment caches hold detached display state and
  follow the ordinary repository-fill lifetime and refresh rules.

### Selection context

- When tree changes are displayed, non-zero insertion and deletion counts for
  the selected commit appear immediately before the right selection tail.
- When a selected commit is pointed to by local refs, display at most one
  deterministic relationship. Prefer a configured-upstream relation as
  `⇡ahead⇣behind`; otherwise, when hidden ancestry exists, show the visible-only
  count as `⇡N`.
- Relationship walks use the in-memory graph, stop once no further distinction
  can be made, and cache completed results. They must never reopen a repository
  merely because selection moved.

### Ref-tree overviews

- After traversal completes, `t` toggles history and a rounded rail ref-tree.
  `Escape` also returns directly to history. The ref-tree cursor and viewport are
  independent of the history selection and panes. The direct ref-tree action
  appears in the `?` information group.
  “Tree” without the `ref-` prefix refers to Git tree objects and tree diffs.
- Entering the overview expands its completed graph with every successfully
  resolved main and linked worktree `HEAD` plus every valid symbolic
  `refs/worktree/tix/pins/HEAD` target. This does not add those commits to the
  history view. Special refs are excluded. First-parent paths form a
  forest whose referenced commits, forks, roots, shallow boundaries, and raw
  tips remain as nodes while linear runs are contracted. `Shift-T` toggles
  tags; when hidden, tag labels and tag-only anchors are removed before this
  projection.
- The component containing `HEAD` sorts first. Children sort by their smallest
  reference label and then object ID. Initial selection is `HEAD`, then a raw
  tip, then the first node; refresh and re-entry preserve the ref-tree cursor when
  its commit remains available.
- The selected node shows the exact number of commits reachable
  through all parents. Other reference and raw-tip nodes show the number reachable
  from them but not from the selection as `N•`; multiple labels at one commit
  share one count. Space fixes this count anchor at the selected node or clears it
  when pressed there again, so cursor navigation can reuse reachability and layout
  caches. Selected first-parent ancestry is emphasized, other reachable history is
  dimmed, and exclusive history remains normal. A non-selectable `●` splits a
  contracted edge where it becomes reachable. Exact exclusive counts are computed
  and cached only for reference rows visible in the viewport.
- The ref-tree orders tips above roots and renders one retained or boundary
  node per row. Rounded ancestry lanes precede aligned counts and labels; their
  `●` disk is the node marker, while the smaller `•` is the commit-count unit.
  Referenced or raw-tip nodes whose commits are present in history use the
  current-history cyan; other linked-worktree nodes use dark green.
  Selection inverts both the node disk and its label, including synthetic nodes
  whose disk is otherwise unlabelled.
- Rendering clips lanes and node labels to the viewport.
- Plain directions choose the nearest node in the requested screen direction.
  `K`/Shift-Up moves toward leaves in the displayed tree and `J`/Shift-Down moves
  toward its root. At a fork, the source disk shows the pending child number
  (`+` beyond nine choices); `h`/`l` cycles, Enter moves, and Escape cancels.
  Navigation does not highlight edges.
- `g` selects the top ref-tree node, and `Shift-G` selects the root of the current
  component. Unshifted mouse pans the viewport, while Shift-mouse moves to the
  nearest node. Unshifted full- or half-page Ctrl/Page input moves the cursor by
  the corresponding viewport distance and keeps it visible; shifted Ctrl/Page
  input pans the viewport without moving the cursor.
- `e` opens node-level reference editing. `d` deletes every eligible local branch
  immediately. `e r` is offered only when selected remote-tracking references
  map uniquely through a named remote's fetch refspecs; it deletes every resolved
  remote reference, grouped into one Git push per remote. Pushes continue after
  individual failures and run with the terminal suspended for output and authentication.
- `p` or `<enter>` on a node with visible references or foreign detached-worktree
  labels creates or reuses symbolic current-worktree pins for every displayed
  local branch, tag, remote-tracking reference, review reference, or foreign
  detached worktree at that commit. Detached-worktree pins target
  `main-worktree/HEAD` or `worktrees/<admin-id>/HEAD` and follow that worktree's
  physical `HEAD` through later commits and branch checkouts, including changes
  made outside Tix. Multiple worktrees at one commit retain distinct pins;
  attached worktree branch labels continue to pin their branches.
  The action returns to history and selects the pinned commit in the first
  refreshed frame, with its cached ancestry and hidden merge-base boundary
  already projected. Synthetic nodes, raw tips, the current detached-worktree
  marker itself, and stash associations have no pin action.
- Worktree branch labels keep the history view's `@branch`, `branch@`, and
  `★branch` forms at the branch's actual tip. A detached current worktree is
  additionally shown with one `📌`; a detached foreign worktree instead uses
  `directory@` at its actual `HEAD`. Ordinary tix pins neither anchor nor
  decorate the ref-tree.
- After deleting selected local or remote references, refresh keeps the commit
  when it remains a ref-tree node, otherwise selects the next surviving node row or
  the nearest previous row when nothing below survives.

### Ref-tree diagnostics

- `tix ref-tree` prints the non-hidden reference projection to standard output without
  terminal colors, selection state, counts, or viewport clipping. A detached
  current worktree renders as `[pin]` in ASCII output and `📌` with `--unicode`.
  It traverses all normal references by default; positional revisions scope
  traversal. Hidden reference labels and traversal tips are omitted, including
  local defaults inferred from remote HEADs unless `--no-auto-hide` is given.
- Worktree traversal is always enabled. `--no-tags` and repeatable
  `-x/--hide <revision>` match the corresponding ref-tree inputs. Output uses
  ASCII lines and `o` nodes by default; `--unicode` uses the interactive
  ref-tree's rounded line and node glyphs.

## Interaction

### Navigation and display controls

| Key | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `j`/Down, `k`/Up | Move one selectable row or changed path. `J`/Shift-Down moves to an ancestor and `K`/Shift-Up moves to a child. |
| Mouse/trackpad vertical scroll | Pan history by the coalesced scroll distance without moving its cursor; Shift moves the cursor instead. Mouse input continues to move paths when a changes block is focused. |
| `h`/`l` | Pan history or the focused changes block horizontally; cycle candidate leaves during tree selection or an ambiguous topological destination. |
| Space / Shift-Space | Start or adjust a tree selection / select the eligible subtree; the palette provides Select subtree on terminals without shifted Space. |
| `Ctrl-u`/`Ctrl-d` | Move the cursor half a page; Shift pans the viewport half a page. |
| `Ctrl-b`/`Ctrl-f`, `PageUp`/`PageDown` | Move the cursor a page; Shift pans the viewport a page. Both forms scroll an overflowing commit message when applicable. |
| `g`/Home, `G`/End | Select the newest/top or oldest/bottom selectable item. |
| `?` | Toggle the information key group. |
| `t` | Toggle the rounded ref-tree overview. |
| `[` | Cycle viewport-local title alignment, full-column alignment, no alignment, and compressed history. |
| `v` | Toggle the history-display key group. Pressing `v` again closes it. |
| `v d` | Cycle author dates, committer dates, and no dates. |
| `v i` | Cycle commit IDs, change IDs, and no explicit IDs. |
| `v c` | Prompt for a displayed entry number and select it within the current tree. |
| `v s` | Toggle full actors/emails and titles. |
| `v e` | Cycle all attribution, author only, and no names, skipping inert states. |
| `v t` | Toggle attribution trailers. |
| `v m` | Toggle mailmap resolution. |
| `v r` | Cycle all, normal, and no reference labels. |
| `Shift-H` / `v h` | Show or hide explicit or inferred hidden ancestry from history or a focused changes pane. |
| `r` | Hide reference labels or restore the mode visible when they were hidden. |
| `m`/`]` | Toggle the commit-message view. |
| `p` | Open the command menu from history or a focused changes block. |
| `Shift-P` | Push the active branch from history or Worktree without a prefix; cycle the comparison parent while Tree has focus. |
| `? e` | Cycle the tree/worktree changes display. |
| `Shift-R` | Explicitly refresh the revision view and visible worktree status. |
| `y` | Copy the full selected commit hash first; when change IDs are displayed, including automatically for siblings, append a space and the full change ID. Copy the selected raw path when a changes block is focused. |
| `Shift-y`/`Y` | Copy the selected author as `Name <email>`. |
| `s` | Verify signed, unverified commits currently visible on screen. |
| `2` | Stash local changes at the departure commit, then time-travel to the selected commit or return through its tix pin. |
| `@` / `Shift-2` | Time-travel with local changes to the selected commit, or return through its tix pin. |
| `x` | Select the next visible commit with the same change ID, wrapping at the end. |
| `u u` / `U U` | Undo / redo one operation. The first press shows an informational confirmation prompt; the second matching press performs the operation. |

The `?` information group documents the direct hidden-history and push shortcuts
alongside its other controls. It shows `sHow related history` or
`Hide unrelated history` when explicit or inferred hidden ancestry is available,
and `Push` when available from history or Worktree. The underlined capital
letters work without a prefix.

Each undo or redo requires a new pair of matching key presses. Switching between
`u` and `U` arms the new direction. Escape cancels the confirmation before leaving
the current pane or returning to the worktree picker. Other keys, mouse input,
paste, or losing terminal focus cancel it as well; modifier-only keys and resize
events preserve it. Key repeat and release events never arm or confirm undo/redo.
New feedback or a conflict also cancels a pending confirmation.
Existing conflict and review restrictions still apply, and `a u` remains rebase
update while `Ctrl-u` remains half-page navigation.

Interactive history replaces known conventional-commit types with bold, colored
symbols:

| Type | Symbol | Color |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `feat` | `+` | Green |
| `fix` | `~` | Yellow |
| `change` | `Δ` | Yellow |
| `remove` | `-` | Red |
| `rename` | `→` | Cyan |
| `refactor` | `↔` | Cyan |
| `perf` | `↑` | Magenta |
| `docs` | `§` | Blue |
| `test` | `✓` | Green |
| `style` | `◇` | Magenta |
| `build` | `#` | Yellow |
| `ci` | `↻` | Blue |
| `chore` | `·` | Dark gray |
| `revert` | `↶` | Red |

Scopes follow the symbol in italic cyan without parentheses. Breaking changes
retain a bold, bright red `!`, so `feat(gix-tix)!: subject` appears as
`+ gix-tix! subject`. Unknown types retain their original prefixes. Subject
Markdown remains intact, including literal leading heading or list markers.

History replaces `fixup! `, `squash! `, and `amend! ` with `↪`, `⊕`, and `✎`
respectively. These badges are bold, underlined light magenta and remain present
when titles are abbreviated. Nested autosquash prefixes collapse to the outermost
badge; the target retains conventional-prefix formatting and literal leading
Markdown markers. For example, `fixup! feat(scope)!: subject` appears as
`↪ + scope! subject`. Highlighting recognizes the message syntax even when no
eligible target exists, and its emphasis remains visible on selected and HEAD rows.

Hidden boundary rows retain their usual colorless styling. Plain `tix show`,
rebase todos, commit-message panes, and enrichment notes keep the original
prefixes.

Alignment uses only rows in the current viewport to determine widths and starts
in title mode. Hidden boundary rows remain unaligned and do not participate in
alignment width calculations. Title, full-column, and compressed alignment discard unused
trailing graph cells before placing metadata. If their shared title column
leaves less than 60% of the average rendered width of visible commit titles,
rows first fall back to natural per-row spacing. If that leaves less than 60%,
symbolic prefixes drop their scopes and unknown conventional types become `…`.
Both retain any breaking-change `!` and one space before the subject. If the
shortened titles still fall below 60%, rows retain their gutters
and complete graph, followed by one space and the shortened title; other
metadata is hidden. Widths are terminal display cells and exactly 60% retains
the more detailed form. Explicitly selected unaligned history retains scopes
and metadata and remains horizontally scrollable.

Topological navigation follows every parent and child edge in the displayed
history. A single destination is selected immediately. If there are multiple,
the cursor stays put and its commit disk shows the pending one-based choice
(`+` beyond nine choices); `h`/Left and `l`/Right cycle with wrapping, Enter
moves, and Escape cancels.
Parents retain commit order, children retain display order, and paths through
ineligible rows are contracted and deduplicated. A viewport panned away with the
mouse or page keys stays detached until movement makes its destination visible.

Compressed history keeps the visible reference, pin, and worktree tips, the
commit selected when compression begins, every graph endpoint or junction, and
every hidden boundary as full, selectable commit rows. Each remaining maximal
linear segment of at least two commits is represented by a selectable hollow
node followed by its exact commit count, such as `○ [12]`; a singleton remains
a full commit row. Pressing Enter on a summary expands that one segment in place;
expansions accumulate until the display is the ordinary title-aligned history.
Topological navigation peels one connected commit from a segment per step.
Moving toward a summary exposes and selects its connected boundary commit.
Starting on a summary instead exposes the boundary in the requested direction
and keeps the remaining summary selected, so repeated steps progressively open
it; when only one member remains, that ordinary commit inherits the selection.
Filtered target selection still exposes ineligible boundary commits one at a
time without selecting them.

Modal review and rewrite-target pickers retain the
compressed projection so its points of interest remain available as targets,
while conflict selection continues to show the full history. Leaving and
re-entering compressed mode through the `[` cycle, or performing a full history
reload, discards accumulated expansions.

After a tap, the display group remains open for consecutive display changes and
closes on navigation or another recognized command. The `?` group similarly remains open
for signature verification, alignment, message, and changes actions. The
footer keeps every prefix compact. Opening one reverses its label and shows its available
items in a reversed popout immediately above and connected to that label. The
actions popout has commit operations in its first logical section and general
actions in its second. The `?` popout likewise has information actions first,
then the command-menu shortcut, pane switching, and keyboard navigation through
`<enter> diff`; other groups use one logical section. The popout has horizontal
padding and shifts left at the terminal edge. Complete items that would cross
the edge spill into additional rows while preserving the declared row order; an
individual item wider than the terminal is clipped. The whole popout is omitted
when its label, the required rows above the footer, or space needed to preserve
a protected message is not visible. It does not reserve history rows and may
cover history, but message and changes panes, their status lines, and transient
notices shift upward to reserve all of its rows and are never occluded.
Direct status actions and quit remain in the footer. The history status starts
with the history position, then the `p` command entry and the `v` and `a`
prefixes when they are addressable. Remaining history-level
actions end at the information prefix while it is closed. An available direct
time-travel action follows the shortcut groups as `2 stash & travel · @ with worktree`,
substituting `return` for `travel` at a pinned destination. When current worktree
status confirms there are no staged, unstaged, or untracked changes, omit the
`2` hint and show just `@ travel` (or `@ return`). Missing, failed, or unwatched
status retains both hints. The shortcuts themselves remain available.
Duplicate cycling follows it when
the selected commit has duplicates, and copy follows these actions; the reference toggle immediately precedes
the `?` group; quit is always last.
All status lines embed and underline a shortcut character in its action label when
possible; keys that cannot be expressed naturally in the label remain explicit.
The Enter key is written as `<enter>` throughout.
Grouped shortcut keys and actions are declared once in the command catalog and
shared by menus, footer hints, and keyboard dispatch. A base letter with Shift
and its uppercase key event have the same meaning in every group. Control-key
paging retains priority, and undo/redo still ignore key-repeat events.

On terminals that report key releases through the enhanced keyboard protocol,
and with native Windows keyboard events, holding any of `a`, `v`, `n`, or `?`
for 300 ms enters command browsing. The initial press still toggles its group
immediately; releasing before the hold threshold preserves the ordinary tap
behavior. Terminals without release events retain the tap behavior. Prefix-key
repeats neither toggle the group again nor execute a command.

Holding selects the first displayed, available command in the open group and
shows its short help. The highlight identifies the browsing selection separately
from each command's active toggle state. Help follows the exact command identity
and current focus: Amend describes the selected Worktree path when focused,
Spill describes the selected Tree path and displayed parent, and Discard
describes the selected Worktree path. All catalog commands provide help.

While browsing, `h`/Left and `l`/Right select the adjacent command in the same
rendered row. `j`/Down and `k`/Up move to the nearest horizontal-center command in
the next selectable rendered row, including rows created by wrapping. Movement
clamps at the edges without wrapping. Shifted `H`, `J`, `K`, and `L` also navigate
while holding `?`. Releasing the held prefix or pressing `<enter>` executes the
selected command once and closes the group. Escape cancels without execution.
Other existing shortcuts still execute normally and end the gesture, so a later
prefix release cannot execute a second command. Losing terminal focus, opening
a competing overlay, or losing the displayed selection through availability or
layout changes cancels browsing. The command palette retains its own navigation,
selection, and submission behavior.

### Command menu

- View has one history toggle, available as `Shift-H` or `v h`. While full
  history is shown it offers **hide unrelated history**, which applies the
  explicit or inferred hidden revisions. While filtered it offers
  **show related history**, which restores the full ancestry of the same view tips.
  It is absent when no hidden revisions are available. Toggling changes only the view: it
  creates or removes no pins and adds no undo entry. Existing pins continue to
  define the view tips.
- Bare `p` opens a centered command menu from the main history UI, including
  while a changes block has focus. In the reference tree, `p` pins the selection
  and returns to history, just like `<enter>`. Its `p command` hint appears in
  `?` help; the main status line omits it.
- The menu contains the currently available executable entries from the Actions,
  View, Enrich, and Information groups. Each entry retains its exact contextual
  identity, so Stash and Unstash, Review and Finish Review, and Pin and Unpin are
  distinct commands rather than interchangeable labels for one action.
- A single-line input filters entries by a case-insensitive ordered-subsequence
  match against the command label or displayed prefix-group name. The unscoped
  `commit` query also finds all Actions and Enrich entries plus commit-message
  and changes information. Up and Down move the selection,
  `<enter>` executes it, Escape closes the menu, and pasted text edits the query
  instead of invoking history paste behavior.
- A displayed prefix key followed by an ASCII space scopes the menu to that
  group: `v ` selects View, `a ` Actions, `n ` Enrich, and `? ` Information.
  With no suffix every available entry in the group matches; further text
  fuzzy-filters command labels within that group. The literal query remains in
  the input, and an invalid or unavailable scope has no matches.
- The unfiltered catalog interleaves View, Actions, Enrich, and Information
  entries while preserving each prefix group's own order, so the first screen
  represents every available group instead of being filled by one prefix.
- At most nine matching entries are visible and numbered `1` through `9`;
  pressing a displayed number executes that entry. The first opening has no
  default selection, so `<enter>` alone does nothing. On later openings, the
  last exact command submitted through this menu is preselected when it is still
  available; an available contextual opposite is not substituted. Typing a query
  replaces that recalled selection with the first matching entry.
- View Select, also available as `v c`, prompts for a `#N` history position.
  `<enter>` moves the cursor to that number in the selected row's current rooted
  tree, Escape cancels, and a number belonging only to another tree is rejected.

### Time-travel

- On a completed, focused history in a worktree repository, `2` on a non-`HEAD`
  row saves local changes before travelling; `@` and terminals reporting
  `Shift-2` carry them through `git checkout --detach <commit>` without forcing
  local changes. Both shortcuts have the same availability and preserve numeric
  input precedence. Stashing travel to the current `HEAD` is a no-op; `@` can
  still replay a pending `HEAD`.
- Stashing travel uses the existing commit-stash namespace and includes staged,
  unstaged, and untracked changes, preserves the ordinary Git stash stack, and
  leaves ignored files in place. Clean departures create no stash; an existing
  departure stash is never overwritten. Destination validation leaves the source
  unchanged; conflict previews leave local changes at the departure. Saving
  happens immediately before
  checkout or replay persistence, so commit rewrites also move the departure
  stash association. If earlier replay steps already completed, their updates
  remain and saved changes are restored at the mapped departure before waiting;
  consumed departure-stash rewrites are removed from the pending undo record.
  Declining a conflict preview leaves changes at the source;
  acceptance saves them before materializing conflicts. Failure restores the
  original references and checkout before applying saved departure changes.
  Failed restoration retains the complete stash and reports its recovery ref.
- `a h` is available while `HEAD` is detached with a valid symbolic HEAD pin.
  It atomically moves the remembered local branch to the current `HEAD` commit
  and attaches `HEAD` without changing the index or worktree. The symbolic HEAD
  pin remains and follows the moved branch. The branch's previous tip receives
  an ordinary pin only when no other normal view tip still reaches it; an
  ordinary destination pin is consumed normally.
- Attach refuses a remembered branch checked out by another worktree. It is
  unavailable during conflicts or incomplete history, but otherwise permits
  dirty index and worktree state because the operation changes only refs.
- When tix detaches an attached local branch, it records that branch symbolically
  in the singleton `refs/worktree/tix/pins/HEAD` ref. Git stores this HEAD pin
  privately for the current worktree, and later branch advances move its tip.
  Further detached travel preserves the singleton. Landing on an available
  remembered branch tip uses that branch as the checkout target directly,
  reattaches `HEAD` in one checkout, and removes the HEAD pin; explicitly
  attaching another branch also removes it.
  Attach is the exception: it deliberately retains the symbolic HEAD pin
  after attaching its remembered branch.
  A failed automatic reattachment leaves both detached `HEAD` and the HEAD pin
  intact and reports a warning. External Git checkouts do not reconcile it.
- Other departures are provisionally retained with ordinary
  `refs/worktree/tix/pins/<suffix>` refs. An already detached `HEAD` receives a
  direct pin. After a successful checkout tix removes that pin when the old
  `HEAD` remains reachable from another view tip, and retains it otherwise. Pins
  use at least four alphanumeric characters; generated pins start with eight
  hexadecimal characters from the saved commit.
- When a rebase rewrites a detached departure, checkout applies the rebase mapping
  before deciding whether to pin it. A departure rewritten into the selected `@`
  successor is not pinned; a distinct departure preserves its rewritten identity.
- While `HEAD` is detached, every valid pin, including the HEAD pin, from the
  current worktree augments implicit and explicit revision tips. While it is
  attached, every ordinary pin away from `HEAD` does so while the HEAD pin is
  inactive. This lets explicitly pinned references and unrelated retained trees
  remain in history. Pins from other worktrees, dangling,
  malformed, and non-commit pins do not enter the view or its decorations.
  Normal hidden-revision exclusions still apply. An ordinary pin at attached
  `HEAD` remains decorated and can be removed, including when that commit is
  displayed only as a hidden boundary, but does not add another history tip.
- One or more worktree pins at a commit are shown as a single blue `📌`
  resource marker immediately after the hash and outside ordinary reference
  decorations. It remains visible when references are hidden, and internal pin
  names are omitted from history rows. Time travel to a pinned
  tip uses a local-branch pin to attach or a direct pin to detach, then removes
  that one pin. Symbolic pins for other reference namespaces are ignored and
  retained. Multiple matching checkout pins prefer local branches and then
  lexical ref-name order.
- The HEAD pin instead marks its target branch as `★branch` in the local-branch
  style. It has no `📌`, is never selected as a return destination, and does not
  offer `unpin`; its branch keeps normal tracking-relation behavior.
- The edit menu offers `pin` on an unpinned row and `unpin` on a pinned row,
  both on `a i`. Pin creates or reuses a direct current-worktree pin for the
  selected commit. Unpin atomically removes every non-HEAD pin for that commit;
  both operations retain that row's selection.
- `tix pin <REVSPEC>...` resolves every argument before writing and deduplicates
  pin targets in argument order. A direct reference name creates or reuses a
  symbolic current-worktree pin so it follows later reference updates; derived
  revisions and object IDs remain fixed direct pins. Each unique target prints
  as `pin:<suffix> <short-id>`, and targets at the same commit remain distinct.
- Checkout failures retain the original `HEAD`, remove only a newly created
  source or HEAD pin, and leave destination pins intact. Successful travel
  consumes a destination pin and applies the same source-pin reconciliation for
  ancestor, descendant, and sideways moves. Conflict acceptance, history-rebase
  checkout, and paste checkout use this same primitive. Successful travel
  preserves the selected row, refreshes history directly, and invalidates
  worktree status.
- Active review commits define review trees containing all of their descendants.
  Time travel within one review tree uses the chosen travel mode: `2` or
  `--stash` saves changes at the departure commit, while `@` or plain CLI travel
  carries them through ordinary checkout. Crossing out of a dirty review tree
  always saves tracked, staged, unstaged, and untracked state with Git under
  `refs/worktree/tix/review/stashes/N`; ignored files remain untouched. Crossing
  into any commit in that review tree restores the state with `git stash apply
  --index` and removes the companion ref only after Git succeeds. A conflict or
  other apply failure retains the complete stash and reports that it remains
  available, including when Git stops before restoring all files. Any partially
  restored state remains in the index/worktree for inspection or conflict
  resolution. Leaving a review tree retains its leaf with the normal direct
  departure pin even after returning to attached history; returning through that
  pin consumes it. Nested trees use the nearest review-root ancestor.
- When loaded worktree status shows staged, unstaged, or untracked changes without
  conflicts, the actions menu offers `sTash` (`a Shift-T`) at the selected `@`
  entry. Missing or stale worktree status hides the action instead of performing
  another status query. Saving uses Git with `--include-untracked`, leaves ignored files alone,
  preserves the ordinary stash stack, and records the stash commit at
  `refs/tix/stash/<full-commit-id>`. A commit can retain only one such stash.
  `tix stash` performs this operation directly at `HEAD` with the same checks.
- A commit stash is shown as a bright `🎁` beside any `📌`, directly after the
  hash and outside reference visibility. Time travel back to that exact commit
  restores it with `git stash apply --index` and consumes its companion ref only
  after Git succeeds. Consuming a stash also removes its association rewrites
  from travel's undo record. Conflicts and other apply failures retain the complete
  stash, just as with automatic review stashes. Commit stashes, whether saved
  manually or during travel, use the same plumbing during reviews, while
  automatic review stashes retain their
  review-tree identity and namespace. An active automatic
  review stash likewise shows `🎁` on the review leaf whose worktree state it
  saved, without exposing its internal reference or stash commit to traversal.
- At a selected `@` with a commit stash, the actions menu offers `unsTash`
  (`a Shift-T`) even when other worktree changes are present. It applies and
  consumes the stash in place only on success, through the same path used when
  time travel returns to that commit.
- Rewriting a commit atomically renames its commit-stash association alongside
  other reference updates. Dropping a stashed commit, converging multiple stashes
  onto one result, or overwriting an existing destination stash is rejected before
  prepared objects or references are persisted.

## Overlay views

Overlay views paint over history without changing metadata alignment. Selection
is bounded above the top-most changes block: moving down at that boundary scrolls
history so the selected row stays visible. Shrinking a changes block does not
pull history back into the freed rows. The commit view reserves right-side
space first; changes blocks adapt within the remaining history width.
Rows uncovered by a shrinking or dismissed overlay retain their gutter, graph,
and metadata columns. Terminal output preserves each wide emoji's measured
width without separately writing blank cells covered by the glyph. This also
applies when switching between history, the worktree picker, ref-tree, and diff
views.

### Commit message

- `m` or `]` toggles the commit view on the right. It uses at most half the
  terminal and reserves 80 content columns when space permits.
- Its history-status action says `message`, avoiding confusion with the edit
  group's commit-creation action.
- The panel has a minimally shaded background derived from the detected terminal
  background, with the default background as fallback. Its content has two
  columns and one row of margin; an overflow status uses the bottom margin.
- A note renders its bold Markdown title and body first without a separate
  background, followed by a horizontal rule and the commit's bold Markdown title
  and body. Standard Git notes retain their bold purple `Notes`
  prefix and render their content as Markdown. Heading markers and code fences
  are hidden, fenced code uses generic styling without syntax highlighting, and
  commit trailers remain plain and aligned last.
- Overflow is page-scrollable and gets a distinct pane status line only when
  scrolling is possible.

### Tree and worktree changes

- Changes start enabled as `Tree + Worktree`. `? e` cycles `Tree + Worktree` →
  `Tree` → hidden. Bare repositories omit the worktree mode.
- Each block has a top border carrying its compact summary. Tree summaries show
  the selected short hash; worktree summaries distinguish staged and unstaged
  counts. Kind totals, total files when non-redundant, and non-zero line totals
  are color-coded. Empty enabled Tree and Worktree blocks remain visible, say
  `empty` and `clean` respectively in green, and are not focusable.
- Tree paths preserve tree-diff order. Worktree paths show staged entries first in
  green and unstaged/untracked/conflicted entries second in bright red, sorted by
  raw path within each group. When both groups exist, a non-selectable `↑ index ↑`
  divider scrolls between them; its dimmed label aligns with the path-kind letters
  and a green horizontal rail fills the inset content width to its right.
- Path kinds are `A`, `M`, `D`, `R`, `C`, `T`, and `U`. The selected path is
  subtly inverted and appends its already-computed non-zero line counts.
- Blocks are side by side when both condensed titles fit, otherwise Worktree is
  stacked above Tree. A shared vertical divider joins side-by-side blocks. Blocks
  size to content but together use no more than half the terminal.
- Stacking changes blocks has no independent effect on history-row detail; only
  the resulting drawable history width participates in adaptive title layout.
- If paths overflow, the final row reports the remaining line count and updates
  while scrolling. A single path is never replaced by overflow text.
- `Tab` cycles focus in visual order through visible changes blocks and history.
  Inactive blocks, including paths and borders, are dimmed. Only the focused
  block shows its distinct status line.
- A selected Worktree path offers `Actions discard` (`a d`), regardless of the
  selected history entry. Unstaged changes restore that path from the index;
  untracked and intent-to-add files are removed. Staged or conflicted changes
  reset that path in both the index and worktree to HEAD, including any unstaged
  edits to the same path. An unborn HEAD uses the empty tree. Renames restore
  their source and remove their destination; copies only remove the destination.
  Paths are literal, unrelated paths and history remain unchanged, and stale
  selections or unsupported submodule changes report an error. Discard closes the
  actions group, refreshes the changes panes, and reports its result in a notice.
- `Shift-P` cycles the comparison parent while Tree has focus. Merge commits are
  compared to one parent at a time; root commits compare against an empty tree.
- Repeated history keys, including printable `j`/`k` reported through enhanced
  keyboard input, and vertical mouse bursts temporarily hide changes
  overlays without changing the history row layout. They return after 75 ms of
  navigation idle, with the same path selection and viewport where possible.
- Tree diff results, detached diff resources, and line counts use a bounded MRU
  while changes remain enabled. Worktree results are cached separately and
  invalidated by relevant filesystem events.
- Per-file line information is computed once in a lazily activated
  `available_parallelism` worker pool. One repository is opened per activation
  and cheaply cloned into thread-local worker handles; per-batch diff platforms
  are discarded after use. Ten seconds without a completed line-count batch
  joins the workers and releases their repositories. The next uncached diff
  reactivates the pool, while hiding changes drops it immediately.

### Diffs

- `Enter` in history opens the whole selected commit against the active parent.
  `Enter` in a focused changes block opens only its selected path.
- A whole-commit diff starts with commit identity and a Git-style per-path
  diffstat in diff order. Each textual path retains Git's churn count and bar,
  followed by an aligned signed net `additions - deletions` count. Parent/root,
  kind totals, and aggregate line totals follow before the internal patch and any
  per-path external diff drivers.
- Diff preparation honors Git attributes, text conversion, binary detection,
  external diff commands, and the configured `core.pager` pipeline.
- Binary, submodule, conflicted, and otherwise unavailable file diffs do not
  launch an inappropriate pager; the changes status line reports the reason.
- The built-in viewer takes over the alternate screen and supports the same
  vertical and horizontal navigation keys. `Enter` advances from a whole-commit
  internal diff to external drivers; `q` or `Escape` returns to tix.
- External programs run with the terminal suspended and restored afterward.
  Broken-pipe writes are accepted. If a pager exits within 250 ms, its already
  displayed output is retained until a keypress so short output remains readable.

## Signature verification and editing

### Signatures

- Presence of `gpgsig` or `gpgsig-sha256` marks a commit as signed but
  unverified; history loading does not validate signatures eagerly.
- The `s` hint appears only while the viewport has work to verify and disappears
  after success. Verification uses Git-compatible repository configuration.
- Failures show their count with a bright-red marker. Moving the history
  selection resets failed visible states to unverified so verification can be
  retried.

### Reword

- `e`, then `r`, is available for editable ordinary commits after history completion,
  including ancestors of merge commits.
- The configured Git editor receives a document containing `Author`,
  `AuthorDate`, `Committer`, `CommitterDate`, `CommentChar`, and the complete
  message in a temporary `.md` file for syntax highlighting. Author identity and
  time are retained; the committer fields show the repository's configured
  current committer. When Git's configured author differs from `Author`, a
  commented `ConfiguredAuthor` directly below it can be uncommented to override
  `Author` while retaining `AuthorDate`.
- The document appends the same commented Git-style per-path diffstat as
  new-commit editors, including churn, signed net line counts, and totals. Counts
  compare the selected commit with its first parent, or the empty tree for a
  root. Pending rebases use their recorded original parent.
- `CommentChar` is a non-empty single-line byte prefix, defaults to `;`, and is
  recognized only at column zero. Parsing removes those lines and applies
  Git-style whitespace cleanup.
- Missing `Assisted-by` and `Co-authored-by` trailers are offered as adjacent
  `;`-prefixed opt-ins. Their values come from `tix.trailer.assistedBy` and
  `tix.trailer.coAuthoredBy`, defaulting to `GPT 5.6` and
  `GPT 5.6 <codex@openai.com>` respectively. Following comments identify the
  winning configuration file, a non-file override source, or the key that can
  replace a default. Configured values must be non-empty and single-line. A
  case-insensitive existing trailer key suppresses its suggestion, regardless
  of value.
- An unchanged editor document is a no-op. Otherwise tix recreates the commit,
  signs it when commit-signing configuration is enabled, and rewrites every
  descendant with corrected parentage, preserving its tree when parent content is
  unchanged. Pending descendants retain their original parent or merge replay
  checkpoint for time travel. Rewording an already-pending commit retains that state;
  an edited commit whose tree and parent are already final needs no replay marker.
  Mutable refs follow every rewritten commit; tags and remote-tracking refs remain
  unchanged.
- Rewording preserves staged and unstaged changes. A metadata-only rewrite does
  not reset the index of any worktree whose checked-out tree is unchanged,
  including linked worktrees and empty rewritten descendants. Index entries,
  flags, and staged-only files are retained exactly.
- Every commit object actually rewritten by an edit receives the repository's
  current committer identity and date immediately before signing and writing.
  Edited committer fields cannot override it; untouched commit objects retain
  their existing identity and object ID.
- Command-line message inputs replace only the message, retain
  editor-comment-looking lines as content, and are a no-op when their cleaned
  message already matches the commit.
- Editor, signing, parsing, writing, or reference-update failures are shown in
  the main status line and do not leave a repository retained by the UI.

### New commits

- If excluding hidden history leaves no visible commit, each current view tip is
  shown as a selectable boundary without exposing its ancestry. An unborn
  `HEAD` instead falls back to the configured hidden branch tips. A born base
  supports creating the first stack commit and editing an empty rebase todo;
  rebase-update can advance it to a newer hidden tip without requiring a commit.
  Creating on an unborn base creates the branch there without moving the hidden branch.
- `a w` creates a child of the selected commit from tracked changes, or a root
  commit for an unborn `HEAD`. A changed index wins; otherwise, tracked worktree
  changes are used. Untracked files never enter an implicit new commit and remain
  untracked. It is available only with a live worktree, after history completion,
  including when the selected parent has merge descendants.
- `a Shift-N` creates an explicit empty commit which reuses the selected parent's
  tree, or the empty tree for an unborn history. Existing index and worktree
  state is preserved exactly. Both forms reject unresolved index conflicts.
- `a Shift-W` (`neW-below`) commits staged changes, or tracked worktree changes
  when the index matches `HEAD`, immediately below the selected `HEAD` commit.
  It requires an editable ordinary commit, including a root; reviews, AutoMerges,
  merge commits, pending commits, hidden boundaries, and unresolved conflicts
  are ineligible. The worktree-changes cache advertises it alongside `new` only
  at an eligible `HEAD`.
- Insertion below applies the selected delta onto HEAD's parent tree in memory,
  then replays HEAD onto the new commit. Both steps must merge cleanly and their
  final tree must match the selected candidate tree. Conflicts abort before the
  editor opens without materializing a conflict or changing repository state.
  Editor cancellation likewise leaves objects, refs, the index, and worktree
  unchanged. A successful insertion keeps HEAD on the rewritten upper commit,
  selects the new lower commit, and leaves sibling commits untouched. Descendants
  follow normal lazy-rebase rules. The active worktree files are never checked out;
  resetting its index to the rewritten HEAD leaves exactly the uncommitted remainder.
  Other affected worktrees use normal checkout preflight and preserve their local
  staging; conflicting local changes abort the operation.
- Ordinary creation, empty creation, and `tix new` reject a pending selected parent,
  including when it differs from `HEAD`. Insertion below checks both `HEAD` and
  the new commit's immediate parent. These checks use only those commits' own
  states: older pending
  ancestry does not block creation or require replay, whether hidden tips are
  available or not. AutoMerge parents remain eligible and use normal AutoMerge
  dependency maintenance. Unborn root creation has no parent to validate.
- A current worktree-changes cache controls which actions are advertised without
  opening a repository: tracked changes offer `new` and `new-empty`, plus
  `neW-below` at an eligible `HEAD`, while a
  clean or untracked-only worktree offers only `new-empty`. If no current cache is
  available, eligible creation actions are shown and validate their candidate before opening the
  editor, directing an empty candidate to `new-empty`.
- Before launching the editor, tix resolves identities, signing configuration,
  index conflicts, filters,
  candidate tree, per-path diffstat, and a provisional commit entirely through an
  in-memory object database. Cancellation and preflight failure write no object,
  reference, index, or worktree state.
- A changed index supplies the complete commit tree and wins over unstaged
  changes. Otherwise, when the worktree `HEAD` is the selected parent, tracked
  worktree changes are filtered into a tree. A normal `new` rejects a tree equal
  to its parent; `new-empty` deliberately reuses it.
- The Markdown editor buffer contains editable identities and dates, a `what`
  title, a `why` body, optional attribution trailers, and a commented Git-style
  per-path diffstat with signed net line counts. Commit hooks are not run.
- After editing, tix revalidates the destination, applies configured signing,
  marks descendants needing tree replay as pending, persists the prepared
  objects, and atomically advances mutable refs throughout the rewritten stack. This includes local
  branches, custom refs, direct tix pins, and a detached `HEAD`, while excluding
  tags and remote-tracking refs. Checked-out affected worktrees are preflighted;
  inaccessible or conflicting affected worktrees abort safely.

### Amend, spill, and split

- `a e` amends the current worktree's `@` commit with the changed index, or
  worktree changes when the index already matches `HEAD`. `a l` spills that
  commit's tree delta into the worktree by replacing its tree with its first
  parent's tree, or the empty tree for a root commit. Clean operations are
  unavailable and report a no-op through `tix amend|spill`.
- Command-line `tix amend --index` disables the worktree fallback. It amends
  staged index content when present and reports `nothing to amend` when the
  index matches `HEAD`, even if tracked worktree changes exist. This option does
  not alter the history-view amend action.
- Command-line `tix amend` finalizes a resolved conflict materialized at a pending
  `HEAD`. Unresolved index conflicts and pending commits below `HEAD` remain
  rejected.
- Command-line edits use the same default HEAD, applicable pin, review tips, and
  inferred hidden base as the history view. Unrelated refs do not broaden their
  descendant rewrite scope, while mutable refs pointing into that scope are
  still retargeted.
- After any command-line amend, spill, split, reword, new, rebase, or pending
  time-travel replay, successfully retargeted commit refs are printed after the
  command's existing result as sorted `full/ref/name: old-id -> new-id` lines.
  IDs use the same seven-character display as other command results. Ref
  creations, deletions, unchanged refs, and unreferenced replayed commits add no
  mapping line.
- With a path selected in the focused tree-changes block, the main `a` prefix
  offers `spill` and `a l` spills only that path against the displayed parent.
  `tix spill PATH...` atomically spills the named paths against the first
  parent; omitting paths keeps the whole-commit behavior.
- With a path selected in the focused worktree-changes block, the main `a`
  prefix offers `amend` and `a e` amends only that path. A staged row uses its
  index version; an unstaged row uses its filtered worktree version. If both
  rows exist for one path, the selected row determines the version. Unresolved
  indexes cannot be amended. Unrelated staged entries retain their index state.
  The CLI intentionally supports only whole-commit amending.
- `a Shift-S` is offered at `@` only when both staged and unstaged changes exist. It
  amends the unstaged changes into the source commit, then creates a new upper
  commit from the staged delta using the standard Markdown editor buffer. Both
  deltas are three-way applied in memory before the editor opens, so overlapping
  changes abort without writing objects or changing refs, the index, or files.
- `tix split [--todo]` performs the same split at `HEAD`: worktree changes are amended
  into the source commit and staged index changes become the new commit on top.
  Its upper-commit editor uses the same enrichment headers as the new-commit
  editor; `--todo` enables its Todo header. Existing source enrichments stay
  with the rewritten lower commit.
- A successful split leaves the worktree bytes untouched and resets the index to
  the new upper commit. The rewritten source retains its message and ancestry;
  the upper commit receives the edited message. Their final trees and ancestry
  need no replay marker; rewritten descendants use the same lazy rebase as amend
  and spill.
- Editing final commits leaves worktree files untouched and cheaply rewrites
  descendants. Resolving a pending merge can update the worktree to the next
  conflict phase or completed merge result. Whole-commit edits reset the affected
  worktree's index to the rewritten commit; selected-path amend synchronizes only
  its destination and renamed source. A directly amended or spilled non-review
  commit already has its final tree and unchanged parent, so it is signed
  immediately when configured and is never pending. A zero-delta commit
  immediately adopts and is signed against its rewritten parent tree whenever
  that parent is final; it remains lazy only behind a pending parent. Previously
  final descendants whose result and ordered parent trees stay unchanged also
  remain final after their parent IDs change. Other reparented descendants carry
  `tix-rebase-parent`, retaining the original parent needed for later replay.
  Pending forms use a grey commit marker so they remain distinct from unsigned
  blue. A final descendant whose effective parents did not change retains its
  exact commit instead of being replayed merely because it is checked out.
- Edit graph discovery follows refs that point to commits and ignores refs whose
  targets are trees, blobs, or other non-commit objects.
- Time travel cherry-picks and signs pending editable ancestry through its
  destination, including pending sides retained beneath finalized ordinary merges
  and their descendants. Finalized review roots, hidden boundaries, and shallow
  boundaries stop this traversal. Later non-empty descendants needing tree
  replay become or remain lazy and unsigned; zero-delta descendants finalize
  immediately while their parent is final and remain lazy behind a pending parent. Traveling toward
  a non-pending ancestor leaves the entire pending region untouched. A completed
  final replay does not reload history;
  another pass loads only the rewritten path and never unrelated references.
  A conflict retains the ours tree, exact merge-result
  tree, conflict stages, prepared commits, and in-memory objects without changing
  the repository. The actual conflicting row is selected and centered with normal
  history-boundary clamping and shows a steady red conflict marker; `<enter>` persists
  the prepared rebase, leaves later descendants lazy, checks out the conflicting
  commit at the ours tree, then checks out the merge result and derives the
  unmerged index from it. `Esc` discards the suspended operation; navigation and
  other read-only actions leave the choice armed, while repository-changing actions
  and refresh are blocked. Key-release events are not actions and leave it armed.
  Once an `Esc` press cancels it, repeats from that press cannot return to or close
  the worktrunk picker.
  Diagnostics warn when a conflict suspends the rebase and record whether it is
  accepted, discarded, or fails during checkout.
- A checked-out unresolved index keeps `C` at `@`, overrides dirty `🫟`, and
  disables time travel until all conflict stages are resolved. The worktree
  changes block is shown for resolution.
- Accepting a conflict remembers the materialized commit, HEAD attachment,
  parents, and accumulated reference changes. If the conflict is resolved and
  amended outside tix, refresh recognizes completion only when HEAD remains
  attached the same way, moves to a same-parent replacement, and the
  conflict-free index exactly matches that replacement's tree. Tix then removes
  any pending-rebase marker preserved by Git's amend, appends both reference
  transitions to the same undo operation, and clears the mandatory prompt.
  Staging a resolution without amending remains incomplete. An unrelated HEAD
  move stays blocked with a diagnostic and can still be left with normal `q`.
  Tix's own `<enter>` amend also completes an identical-tree resolution so no
  pending marker can survive merely because the tree did not change.
- A materialized todo conflict keeps a high-contrast `REBASE PAUSED` attention notice until
  its in-memory continuation is consumed. The notice changes when the index is
  resolved but always advertises `<enter>` to continue and `Esc` to stop. History,
  changes-pane navigation, display toggles, copying, and path-diff inspection stay
  available; repository-changing actions and refresh are blocked. Pane-local
  `<enter>`, `Esc`, and `q` retain their inspection and focus behavior. Stopping
  forgets only the in-memory continuation and leaves the partially applied
  repository untouched; Ctrl-C still exits immediately.

### AutoMerge

- `a Shift-M` creates an AutoMerge at the selected `HEAD`. Its initial input uses
  the single local branch or ordinary pin naming HEAD, or HEAD's effective
  change ID if no unambiguous name exists. A symbolic pin of the same local
  branch does not count twice. Source refs stay where they are and the result is
  checked out detached. The same action adds inputs to an existing AutoMerge HEAD.
- At HEAD, inputs are chosen with the command popup's fuzzy picker, ordered by
  local branches, ordinary pins, remote branches, then tags which peel to commits.
  Choosing an ancestor of HEAD changes nothing and explains why. Inputs retain
  insertion order; an identity can subscribe only once. An AutoMerge cannot
  subscribe to itself or its descendants, including through a branch attachment.
- On a non-HEAD commit outside HEAD's ancestry, the action is labeled
  `AutoMerge into HEAD`. Descendants of an AutoMerge HEAD are excluded. The
  selected commit's local branches and ordinary pins take priority: one
  canonical source is used directly, and multiple sources open the same fuzzy
  picker with branches first. If none exists, Tix uses the commit's effective change ID.
  An available tag or remote ref alone does not replace change tracking. HEAD
  and ancestry are revalidated when the action executes.
- Each live input remains a Git parent. Inputs are merged in order; a conflict
  mutes that input's entire contribution, including files which merged cleanly,
  and merging continues with later inputs. Muted parents are excluded from the
  intermediate ancestry used to calculate later merge bases. The generated
  title groups each status with its input, for example `[✔️ A] [💥 B] [✔️ 📌]`;
  pins show only their symbol and change inputs show abbreviated change IDs with
  the same included or muted symbols. The commit body's `AutoMerge inputs:`
  section contains one bullet per input, in title order, starting with that
  input's status symbol and label. Each bullet explains inclusion or exclusion
  and identifies the full reference or change ID. Pin bullets name the pin and
  its symbolic target when present, so repeated pin symbols remain distinguishable.
  Muted inputs contribute no content because of conflicts or pending replay.
  Eager rebuilds regenerate the title and this section, preserving other body
  text; lazy rebuilds retain the previous message until content is replayed.
  Message generation uses the operation's existing reference snapshots and
  stable source identities, without extra repository reads during UI display.
  Reword, amend, spill, split, and squash cannot edit generated content. Ordinary
  descendants and separate notes/enrichments remain editable.
- A repeated `tix-auto-merge` commit header stores each input's full ref name or
  change ID, last resolved commit, and included/muted state. This identity survives process
  restarts, signing, and lazy rebases, including when several subscriptions
  converge onto one Git parent. Distinct ref subscriptions never collapse merely
  because their commit IDs coincide. Ref inputs use
  `1 <commit-id> <included|muted> <full-ref>`; change inputs use
  `1 <commit-id> <included|muted> change-id <full-change-id>`. Re-adding a change
  explicitly selects the supplied version of that identity. Unnamed inputs are
  retained by merge parent links; they create no tracking refs or pins.
- Remerging resolves every subscribed ref afresh, following external advances,
  resets, and force rewrites. Deleted refs and their old parents are pruned.
  One surviving subscription collapses the AutoMerge to that tip; zero surviving
  subscriptions retain the previous result with an explanatory notice.
- A change input follows the same logical commit through Tix rewrites and
  retained todo picks, never newly inserted children or copies. Splitting keeps
  the subscription on the lower commit that retains the change ID. Dropping the
  input, or squashing it into a different retained change ID, removes that
  subscription and applies the same collapse rules.
- Exact rewrites and todo placements take precedence over change-ID lookup.
  Otherwise, lookup is enabled only when actual hidden tips bound the active
  history; showing hidden history disables it. The operation builds one lazy
  index over that bounded projection, including offscreen commits. Expanding
  an operation's replay scope does not expand its lookup candidates. Stale cached
  nodes, unrelated histories, reflogs, and unreachable objects are not searched.
  One match selects that version; no match retains the stored commit. Multiple
  matches, including the stored version when present, retain the stored commit
  and report ambiguity; timestamps never decide between versions. CLI diagnostics
  go to stderr, including those carried through rebase, reword, creation, and travel.
- Tix edits, rebases, and branch attachment maintain dependent AutoMerges in the
  current history projection, including offscreen commits and inputs outside the
  projection. Unrelated histories belonging to other worktrees are not expanded.
  Generated commits away from the checkout ancestry may remain lazily rebased.
  `a Shift-R` explicitly remerges the selected AutoMerge HEAD. Traveling onto an
  AutoMerge or an ordinary descendant also refreshes changes made outside Tix,
  including every required AutoMerge parent when ordinary histories merge.
  Watchers only refresh display data and never initiate a remerge.
- Travel replays pending inputs independently. An input whose replay conflicts
  keeps its original tree and replay-base metadata and is muted; other inputs
  can still complete. Direct travel to that input offers normal conflict
  resolution. If every input remains pending, the merge uses their common-base
  tree, or the empty tree when no common base exists.
- `a x` (`exclude from AutoMerge`) removes a selected input tip from an AutoMerge,
  including unnamed inputs.
  Multiple memberships open a picker naming the input ref or abbreviated change
  ID and the AutoMerge, so even converged refs remain distinguishable.
  `a Shift-X` (`eXclude input`) at an AutoMerge selects an input to remove.
  These actions remove subscriptions without deleting input refs. Automatic
  checkout cleanup never consumes a subscribed ordinary pin.
- AutoMerges remain ordinary `pick` lines in rebase todos. Their parents derive
  from refs' planned destinations and change inputs' retained picks across all
  fork sections; deleting a pick drops that AutoMerge. Ordinary merge commands
  preserve their explicit ordered parent slots.
  Derived updates, input replays, notes, signing, ref checks, checkout preflights,
  and undo use the shared edit machinery and one grouped undo operation.
  Input refs are snapshots for each operation. Concurrent changes to inputs that
  Tix does not update are picked up by the next remerge; refs Tix changes retain
  expected-value checks. Unchanged inputs create neither reflog entries nor undo
  changes.
  Edits, review completion, and todos use the same bounded executor for tree
  application, optional-input conflicts, AutoMerge rebuilding, replay markers,
  change-ID inheritance, and signing. Their planning rules remain independent.
- History loading inspects AutoMerge headers throughout the editable projection,
  independently of viewport text loading, and caches both positive and negative
  results by immutable commit ID. Idle application state retains detached recipes,
  selection eligibility, and picker data only. Pin-consuming checkouts may reload
  the current projection to determine which pins must be retained.
  The graph distinguishes an unloaded frontier from a loaded root or shallow
  boundary. Reading an external input's ancestry does not expand the editable
  scope; descendant rewrites remain confined to that scope.

### Reviews

- `a r` starts a review from any eligible non-boundary commit, including ancestors of merges.
  If exactly one selectable strict ancestor can be the review base, review starts
  with it immediately. Otherwise tix limits navigation to the selected commit's
  ancestry; the connected hidden base remains selectable, `<enter>` confirms it,
  and Escape cancels before any repository change.
- Starting does not preflight index or worktree cleanliness; Git's checkout
  decides whether existing changes permit activation. The reviewed tip and base
  must not be pending. After confirmation, tix claims the first numeric identity
  `N` unused by both its review and return refs, creates
  `refs/worktree/tix/review/N` at the reviewed tip, and creates an
  unsigned ordinary `review` commit at the base with
  `tix-rebase: onto refs/worktree/tix/review/N`. Starting always creates a
  dedicated review-owned worktree-local tix pin at
  `refs/worktree/tix/pins/review/N` for the departure, symbolic for an attached
  branch and direct for a detached checkout, and names it in the
  `tix-review-return-to` header. Ordinary travel, pin creation, and unpinning do
  not consume or reuse these pins. HEAD is detached at the review commit,
  its base tree fills the index, and the reviewed tip tree remains in the worktree
  as unstaged changes. The internal pin keeps the departure and its ancestry
  visible without appearing as an ordinary pin decoration.
  If checkout is blocked, the prepared review resources remain and tix reports
  the full review commit ID so the user can clean the index and worktree before
  switching to it.
  Reviews never share return pins, even when they depart from the same ref or
  commit, so finishing one cannot consume another review's return path.
  Finishing maps the recorded return target through the rewrite, deletes that
  exact pin with the review resources, and uses normal time-travel checkout
  semantics to restore attached or detached HEAD. Existing symbolic review refs
  remain readable.
- Review refs are resources, not traversal tips; pins alone retain history. They
  remain visible in every ref mode: one active ref is shown as `review`, while
  multiple refs are shown as `review:N`. Review
  commits replace the normal signature disc with a filled diamond in the graph;
  `@` still takes precedence at `HEAD`. A checked-out review shades the visible
  row prefix purple with contrasting black text up to a one-space margin before
  its title, even while selected. Ordinary
  edits preserve the review header and otherwise keep
  their normal signing and lazy-rebase behavior.
- At a checked-out review commit, amend follows the ordinary index-first,
  worktree-fallback behavior, including worktree-only review deltas. It leaves
  worktree bytes and the review header intact, removes signatures, and marks only
  affected descendants for lazy replay. Pending ancestry below the review
  boundary remains untouched and does not block the amend.
- `a r` finishes a selected review when status is completely clean and the current
  worktree HEAD is the review commit or one of its successors. The
  review commit is inserted after its reviewed tip with its exact tree, review
  header removed, updated committer, and configured signature. Review-side
  descendants retain exact trees and are signed without pending markers. With one
  review-side leaf, the reviewed tip's prior descendants are lazily reparented
  after it; with multiple leaves they branch directly after the finished review.
  AutoMerge boundaries and their descendants rebuild after the input refs settle;
  they do not become insertion points for the reviewed history.
  The resulting review commit's current patch is automatically marked
  `refackiewed` (`✨`), including an empty patch. This marks the finished review
  commit even when checkout returns to a descendant. The approval and review-ref
  deletion share the same atomic ref/worktree transaction; cancelling a suspended
  finish publishes neither.
- If the recorded review return ref is missing, finishing leaves the repository
  untouched and limits navigation to visible non-review commits descended from
  the reviewed tip. The reviewed tip is selected initially when visible;
  otherwise the nearest eligible row is selected. `<enter>` finishes the review,
  maps the chosen commit through that rewrite, and checks it out detached, while
  Escape cancels recovery.
  Hidden, unrelated, and review commits are not selectable return targets.
- Delete is unavailable for a review commit with descendants. Deleting a review
  leaf cancels the review: tracked review changes are discarded, its recorded
  return checkout is restored, and the departure pin is consumed. Finishing a
  review or dropping one through a rebase todo also deletes its review ref and
  optional saved-worktree ref atomically; reordering or rewriting it preserves the
  headers and resources. Review stash refs are internal: they are not traversal
  tips or named decorations, but their saved review leaf carries a `🎁` marker.

### Delete commits

- `a d` immediately deletes a selected ordinary or AutoMerge commit after history
  completion, including when it has ordinary merge descendants. Other merge commits
  remain ineligible.
- Deleting does not require a worktree. Descendants are reparented with
  unchanged trees and marked when tree replay is needed; mutable refs throughout the
  rewritten stack move atomically. Tags and remote-tracking refs remain unchanged.
- When the selected commit is the current worktree `HEAD`, Git preflights and
  applies a two-tree index/worktree transition which discards only that commit's
  tracked delta. Conflicting staged, tracked, or untracked state refuses the
  operation; unrelated untracked content survives. Deleting an AutoMerge uses
  its first parent and preserves the input commits and their refs. When `HEAD`
  is outside the deleted commit's descendant history, including an input just
  below an AutoMerge, it stays where it is without a checkout-target prompt;
  the index and worktree are untouched.
- Deleting an attached root deletes the branch and leaves symbolic `HEAD`
  unborn. A selected detached root is rejected because it cannot produce a valid
  unborn `HEAD`. Success refreshes history and selects the parent when present.

### Transactional rebases

- All edits share one in-memory rebase primitive.
  Forks and ordered merge parents are preserved, and all commit/tree
  preparation—including cherry-pick conflict detection—finishes before objects
  become reachable through refs.
- `Tree::LeaveAsIs` rewrites parentage without changing trees;
  `LeaveAsIsAndMark` records the original parent in `tix-rebase-parent` for ordinary
  single-parent commits, or the merge replay state described below, only when later
  replay needs it; and `CherryPick` transplants each tree delta.
  Any edit that rewrites the current worktree's checked-out ancestry eagerly
  cherry-picks that affected path before committing the operation. The edited
  root of a direct amend or spill already has its final tree and does not receive
  a redundant worktree transition. Transplants additionally replay every selected
  path and required pending destination ancestry. Other affected descendants on
  unrelated branches and in other worktrees remain lazy unless their delta is empty and their parent is
  final, or the metadata-only rewrite rule below applies. A successful repeated
  rebase clears the marker through its checkout destination.
  On conflict, `tix-rebase-parent` identifies the original base and later descendants
  remain marked instead of being cherry-picked.
- Ordinary merges replay every changed parent against the original recorded merge
  tree. For each parent, Tix merges its old tree, the recorded merge tree, and its
  new tree to obtain a candidate; it then combines that candidate with the
  accumulated result using the recorded merge tree as the base. The recorded
  baseline stays fixed throughout replay. This preserves manual resolutions and
  merge-only edits, incorporates shared updates once, and exposes contradictory
  parent updates as conflicts. Ordinary merges never mute a contribution, and
  changed parent IDs must be final before the merge finishes; an unchanged
  parent can remain pending because its recorded contribution stays fixed. An
  unchanged corresponding parent tree requires no content replay. Parent order
  and slots remain intact through planning; identical resulting IDs are deduplicated only
  when writing the Git commit, while ancestry-redundant edges remain.
- Lazy and conflicting ordinary merges carry `tix-rebase-merge` metadata containing
  the original merge ID, current parent index, parent/combine phase, checkpoint ID,
  and ordered destination parent slots. Their actual Git parents always describe
  the intended destination topology. `refs/tix/replay/<pending-commit-id>` retains
  the checkpoint: either the original merge itself, or a private checkpoint commit
  whose tree is the accumulated result and whose sole parent is that original
  merge. These refs and checkpoint commits are hidden from ordinary history,
  decorations, reference following, and editable todo refs. They are published
  atomically with accepted conflicts or lazy results and participate in rollback
  and undo. Cancelling a preview publishes no replay resources.
- A clean staged index resolves the current merge phase through either `tix amend`
  or todo continuation. A parent-phase resolution becomes a candidate to combine;
  a combine-phase resolution becomes the accumulator for the next parent. Another
  conflict materializes the next phase and preserves pending state. Signatures and
  patch identity are finalized only after every phase finishes. Git amend with
  preserved headers likewise resolves one phase. Amending a merge does not execute
  its surrounding todo; later continuation recognizes its finalized replacement.
  An unchanged lazy merge can be replayed by amend; staged content edits to a lazy
  merge require time travel to HEAD first, so they cannot be mistaken for a
  conflict-phase resolution or lost during replay.
- Accepted todos also retain every continuation source, including later lazy
  commits and remaining fold sources, through `refs/tix/replay/todo-<conflict-id>/<commit-id>`.
  Each conflict owns its retention refs, so overlapping continuations remain
  independent. These hidden refs survive amendments and are released only when the surrounding
  continuation consumes their scope. This keeps saved todos usable after restart,
  clearing undo, and Git garbage collection. Their creation and release are
  transactional and undoable.
- Replay checkpoints survive restart and Git garbage collection independently of
  undo. Copying preserves the source occurrence's resources. An affected old
  resource is retired only after a bounded traversal proves its owner unreachable
  from active saved continuations, final non-replay/non-undo refs, and every
  worktree HEAD, including tags,
  remotes, stashes, and other branches. Incomplete traversal retains it. Undo keeps
  deleted checkpoints reachable and restores their refs; clearing undo leaves
  active replay resources intact. There is no background cleanup or idle
  repository ownership for replay resources.
- A previously final commit remains final when a rewrite changes only metadata:
  its result tree and ordered parent trees are unchanged, and every rewritten
  parent is final. Rewording a message or adding a commit header therefore
  reparents and re-signs affected final descendants without tree replay or
  pending markers, including off-checkout forks, ordinary merges, and qualifying AutoMerges.
  Existing pending commits still require their normal replay; metadata changes
  alone never finalize them. Hidden-boundary, checkout, and
  signature restrictions remain in force.
- Checkout-path validation considers only the current edit scope: visible
  commits and their displayed hidden boundary, or the frozen scope of a
  self-contained rebase plan. Cached commits below that boundary do not block
  edits in the visible stack.
- `Signature::RedoIfNeeded` signs every rewritten commit when signing is
  configured and otherwise removes stale signature headers.
  `InvalidateExisting` empties existing signature values when signing is
  configured, making the empty field a pending-signature signal, or removes them
  when it is not. A pending-rebase commit can only use the invalidation policy,
  so it never carries a usable signature. Automatically rebased descendants
  retain their author and receive one configured current committer identity and
  timestamp for the operation.
- Ordinary edits retarget mutable local refs pointing into the rewritten set.
  History todos instead use their explicit reference lines. Ref changes use
  compare-and-swap transactions. One operation owns publication, requested checkout,
  pin cleanup, deferred branch deletion, and accepted conflict materialization;
  completion returns their combined undo changes. Checkout failure rolls back
  refs and worktrees and restores the original index. A failing post-checkout hook
  after Git has reached the destination reports a warning and retains the completed
  checkout in undo history. Newly written unreachable objects may remain for normal
  Git garbage collection.
- A suspended conflict temporarily owns a cloned repository with object memory
  while awaiting an explicit `<enter>` or `Esc` choice. Dropping it writes nothing;
  accepting it consumes the repository immediately after persisting the commit at
  the ours tree and materializing the retained merge result in the worktree and index.
  Delete, reword, commit insertion, review finishing, and other shared-rebase
  callers propagate this same suspended result instead of completing their ref
  transaction first. Thus a checkout-path conflict is reported by the initiating
  edit itself, and `Esc` leaves its repository snapshot unchanged.

### History rebase editor

- Selecting an eligible hidden boundary and pressing `a b` opens a Markdown
  `.md` todo. Its editable plan is read bottom-to-top like the history view:
  newest commands and refs are highest, and each stack ends in a centered
  `──── fork <id> ────` separator below its oldest command.
  IDs are shortened through repository configuration; metadata is loaded across
  the complete todo scope, repeats the full information visible in history, and
  always includes the subject. Base-level
  stacks end with `fork <id> (base) <title>` in the separator, using the title
  exactly as displayed in history without Markdown escaping. Fork points within the editable tree
  remain plain `fork <id>` separators. Every separator is centered with at least
  four `─` characters per side, and all span the widest editable line.
- When that boundary shows `⇣N`, `a u` opens the same editor with each base-level
  stack rooted at the corresponding hidden branch tip. Its otherwise unfamiliar
  separator is `fork <id> (updated-base) <title>`, with the raw title exactly as
  shown in history, including `[A]` and `[N]`. The hidden branch
  itself is not moved.
- `merge <source> <side-parent>…` replays an ordinary merge. The surrounding fork
  supplies its first parent; side parents are ordered commit IDs and can refer to
  results in other fork sections. The command preserves the source's parent-slot
  count, including through continuation; the editor cannot create merges or change
  their arity. All parent dependencies participate in cycle checks and replay
  ordering. Ordinary merges and AutoMerges cannot be fold sources or targets.
- Pick lines may be reordered or removed. `squash <id>`, `fixup <id>`, and
  `fixup -C <id>` fold an existing non-merge commit into the following `pick`
  or `empty` below it in the same fork. A fold may carry `@`, and fork
  separators naming any folded ID resolve to
  the combined result. A fork cannot begin with a fold when read bottom-to-top.
  Fork separators may otherwise target a pick below or any existing commit, so
  adding and removing separators creates
  and joins branches. `empty <title>` inserts an empty commit. Markdown code
  spans and equivalent plain commands are accepted; display text after an ID is
  informational and emitted verbatim without Markdown escaping.
- Fold groups are materialized eagerly on every fork by applying their source
  deltas in bottom-to-top todo order. The result retains the first member's author, author
  time, encoding, and extra headers, starts with its message, receives the operation's committer,
  and is signed once. For `squash`, before every later full message, a permanent
  `# <short-id> <subject>` line identifies its source. Distinct raw authors of
  later squashed commits are appended in first-seen order as `Co-authored-by` trailers,
  excluding the first author and identities already named by a valid such
  trailer in any source message. Name and email pairs are compared without
  mailmap. All folded IDs and mutable refs map to the one resulting commit;
  resources owned by a later folded review commit are removed.
- `fixup` discards its source message and adds no author trailer. `fixup -C`
  replaces the accumulated message with its source's complete message, or with
  the body after the subject paragraph when the source has an `amend! ` marker.
  An empty replacement is allowed. The last replacement wins, including over
  earlier squash messages and generated trailers; subsequent `squash` messages
  append normally. Neither fixup mode changes the first member's author or
  generates a trailer for its source author. No additional message editor opens.
- Initial explicit rebases, including TUI rebase/rebase-update and CLI
  `tix rebase todo`, automatically group commits whose subjects begin with
  `fixup! `, `squash! `, or `amend! ` and mark them as `fixup`, `squash`, or
  `fixup -C`. These are ordinary commits with message conventions, not stored
  target links. Create them with `git commit --fixup=<target>`,
  `--squash=<target>`, or `--fixup=amend:<target>`. Git's
  `--fixup=reword:<target>` creates an `amend!` commit containing only a message
  change and ignores staged changes during creation.
- Autosquash matches original normalized subjects and IDs within each source's
  editable first-parent ancestry. It tries an exact subject, then a commit name
  or hash, then a subject prefix, choosing the earliest matching ancestor.
  Nested markers are stripped for lookup; the outermost marker selects the
  action. Unmatched and out-of-scope targets remain ordinary picks. Ordinary
  merges and AutoMerges cannot be fold sources or targets. Sibling branch
  commits are ineligible, even when displayed earlier in the todo.
- Multiple folds preserve Git's grouping order, including folds targeting an
  earlier fixup by hash. Contributions from separate branches use the original
  generated todo order. Moving a fold reconnects its children through its
  surviving original parent, retaining intervening commits and forks. Branch
  tips and a checkout at a consumed tip stay at the surviving stack tip.
  Shared ancestor targets affect their descendant forks. Moving a patch earlier
  can conflict when it depends on an intervening commit.
- Automatic marking happens only during initial todo generation. Edited
  commands and continuations are applied literally; users can change a generated
  fold to `pick` and reposition it. Internal replays during amend, reword, and
  travel do not automatically fold commits. Unlike Git's opt-in autosquash,
  Tix enables initial marking automatically. Its first-parent restriction,
  automatic squash message composition, and replacement of earlier squash
  messages follow Tix conventions rather than Git's full interactive behavior.
- The first line points to complete self-documenting help after the editable
  todo. All instructions are enclosed in Markdown comments so only separators,
  reference lines, and command lines participate in the editable plan.
- A versioned Markdown state comment makes the document independently
  applicable in a later process. It records full base, target, scope and tip IDs,
  checkout requirements, and compare-and-swap state for mutable refs. Ref names
  use Git-compatible C-style quoting so arbitrary ref bytes round-trip. Missing
  state cancels; present invalid state never reaches repository mutation. The
  state comment follows the complete help at the end of the document. Bottom-up
  todos use `tix-rebase-state-v3`; older state versions are rejected rather than
  interpreted with the opposite command order.
- Standalone `(ref, ref)` lines place direct mutable refs at the following fork
  separator or command result below them. Multiple consecutive lines share that
  destination. When multiple stacks share a fork destination, its mutable refs
  appear once in the generated document.
  Commit command metadata omits ref decorations because these lines are their
  sole editable representation.
  Existing displayed names may be moved or removed, and new unqualified names
  create local branches; explicit editable `refs/...` names are also accepted.
  Existing editable direct refs outside the generated todo are imported with
  their current target as compare-and-swap state and may be placed the same way.
  Short names follow the history display, ambiguous names expand to full names,
  and Git quoting preserves arbitrary bytes. Tags, remote-tracking refs, general
  symbolic refs, tix pins, stashes, and review resources remain hidden and
  unchanged.
- Pick lines use display-only state symbols documented in the footer: `↻` for a
  lazy rebase, `◌` for an invalidated signature awaiting signing, `◐` for an
  unverified signature, and `○` for an unsigned commit. Applicable states may be
  combined without changing plan semantics. Applicable `🚧`, `📝`, and `✔️`
  enrichment gutter symbols appear before the signature-state disk as metadata.
- `@pick`, `@squash`, `@fixup`, `@fixup -C`, or `@empty` chooses the post-rebase
  commit. A generated todo keeps this marker even when `HEAD` is attached, but shows its branch as an
  ordinary ref. Versioned state remembers that attachment while the ref stays
  at the marked result. Moving it elsewhere detaches `HEAD`; adding `@` to one
  editable ref explicitly attaches it and is valid only at the marked result.
  The ref may be imported from outside the generated todo and is moved before
  `HEAD` is made symbolic to it. Removing the name deletes the ref. Checkout
  markers are invalid without a worktree. Todo generation and application
  reject an unborn `HEAD`.
- Within the ancestry ending at `@`, unchanged picks whose original parent is
  still their planned parent retain their IDs. Eager cherry-picking and re-signing
  starts at the first pending or structurally changed commit. Descendants
  above `@` and other resulting stacks retain their trees; those needing tree
  replay receive pending-rebase markers and invalidate old signatures for later
  time travel. Metadata-only rewrites follow the same final-state rule as other
  edits. With no explicit `@`, the current attached branch's resulting destination
  is inferred and its ancestry is replayed eagerly; a detached checkout is not
  inferred. Other ordinary steps needing replay remain lazy while squash groups
  are still materialized.
  Any conflict while applying a history todo first remains entirely in memory.
  The TUI projects the partial result, selects and centers the actual conflicting
  result with normal history-boundary clamping, and marks it with a steady red
  conflict marker; predicted ref decorations remain at their
  repository positions. Repository-backed overlay content is hidden while these
  candidate objects exist only in memory. History and pane navigation and other
  read-only actions leave the preview armed; repository-changing actions and
  refresh are blocked. `<enter>` accepts the partial result,
  moves already-final refs, records the ours tree in the conflicting commit, and
  checks out the retained merge result with an unmerged index,
  and retains an in-memory continuation plan. Only `Esc` discards the preview
  without writes. Cancellation and failed materialization synchronously restore
  the cached repository history before commit-message and changes panes resume
  loading, so the next frame cannot reference discarded in-memory objects.
  On continuation, `<enter>` stages paths that still have unresolved
  index entries, refuses to proceed if any unresolved stages remain, and amends the
  current conflicting commit from the complete staged index, including any additional
  staged changes. Unrelated unstaged changes remain untouched. Another conflict
  repeats the same explicit choice.
- Command-line apply, including todo `--edit-and-apply`, reports a conflict
  without changes unless `--materialize-conflicts` was explicitly supplied. Its
  continuation document uses the full null object ID for the command whose tree
  must come from the resolved index. Already produced commits use their new IDs,
  completed drops and fold sources disappear, unapplied fold sources retain
  their actions, and the remaining todo stays editable. A conflicting fold's
  message action is already recorded on the partial result and is not applied
  again by continuation. Applying it
  requires only that `HEAD` names a commit and the index has no unresolved stages;
  the index tree, including additional staged changes, becomes the resolved tree.
  There is no hidden sequencer state or separate continue/abort command.
- Every interactive operation that rewrites the stack below `HEAD`, including
  todo application, runs on a scoped worker and shows its modal gauge after
  300 ms. TUI time travel also runs on a scoped worker and follows completed
  pending rebases on the destination ancestry. The history selection traverses
  each fixed viewport from bottom to top; crossing its top jumps the viewport
  by one page and places the selection at the bottom again. Compressed history
  temporarily uses its canonical rows for these frames and is restored afterward.
  The first and latest rows are drawn even for fast operations, with intermediate
  rows coalesced to at most 60 fps. Command-line time travel does not animate.
- Displayed mutable refs follow their explicit locations in the edited todo;
  omission deletes them and newly named refs require nonexistence. Refs checked
  by the transaction retain their observed state separately from their planned
  destination: deletion, an existing commit, or a step result. Automatic
  following is resolved once before replay; an unproduced step is an error,
  never a deleted AutoMerge input. Refs checked
  out by linked worktrees are displayed normally and may move, with their index
  and worktree updated through the same preflighted transition as other rebases,
  but may not be deleted. The current worktree's branch may be deleted only when
  the todo also moves or detaches `HEAD`; deletion is deferred until checkout
  succeeds. All remaining moves use one compare-and-swap transaction. Every
  other resulting leaf gets a direct
  `refs/worktree/tix/pins/*` ref, except the checked-out leaf. When `@` moves below
  a referenced leaf, the existing time-travel checkout detaches `HEAD` there while
  the ref stays at the leaf. Concurrent changes to refs being written make the
  transaction fail; the editor result is not rebuilt against a later graph
  snapshot. Leaving the document unchanged is a no-op unless the ancestry ending
  at `@` contains pending commits, rebase-update selected a newer base, or
  autosquash generated folds. Pending commits on other forks remain lazy and
  do not replay a clean checkout ancestry. Explicit
  `tix rebase apply` always
  applies a valid plan, even when its editable commands are unchanged. The first
  Markdown comment states which of these modes applies and explains that emptying
  the file or removing the `tix-rebase-state-v3` comment cancels. Continuation
  todos likewise state that saving unchanged continues the materialized rebase.

### Tree selection and transplants

- Space fixes an inclusive source root, initially selecting only that commit.
  The root must be an editable ordinary commit with exactly one parent. Selected
  paths can include ordinary merges and eligible AutoMerges. Hidden boundaries
  and unresolved conflict placeholders stop traversal; pending ordinary commits
  remain selectable. Discovery uses the
  complete editable projection, including off-screen commits; it never bridges
  a forbidden node by contracting it out of navigation.
- Shift-Space selects the entire eligible subtree and resets adjusted endpoints
  to its original tips. The command palette also offers **Select subtree**;
  the shifted shortcut is advertised only with enhanced keyboard support.
- Before leaf focus, navigation browses with the root fixed. Space on an
  unselected eligible commit adds every eligible root-to-cursor path using the first
  candidate tip containing it in display order; Space on selected membership
  does nothing. Candidate leaf slots retain their original tip, current
  endpoint, and inclusion state.
- The first `h` or `l` focuses the first candidate leaf; subsequent presses cycle
  all candidate slots, including unselected ones, restoring each remembered
  endpoint. `j`/`k` retain row navigation and `J`/`K` retain topological navigation.
  While leaf-focused, movement stays on that candidate's root-to-original-tip
  paths. Selected slots change membership live; unselected slots change only the
  preview. Space toggles the focused slot. Effective membership is the root plus
  all included paths; effective leaves discard overlapping ancestor endpoints.
- Enter advances through separate source, Copy/Move, Fork/Insert, destination,
  Above/Below, and final confirmation stages. Choices default to Copy, Fork,
  and Above when available. Selections containing AutoMerges offer both Copy
  and Move; the mode prompt explains that Copy freezes them and Move keeps them
  live. Multiple effective leaves permit only Fork. Each
  Enter confirms exactly one stage, and a distinct final Enter applies the
  rebase. Space and confirmation ignore key repeats/releases. Escape aborts
  everything, including nested menus and topological choices. No external todo
  editor is offered for the initial transplant.
- A dedicated selection gutter distinguishes root, selected paths, preview
  paths, numbered endpoints, and destination independently of the ordinary
  cursor and existing graph/status symbols. A persistent summary names the
  root, commit/leaf counts, operation, destination, and placement. Compressed
  history temporarily expands and is restored on exit. Resize and redraw retain
  selection. Topology or reference changes invalidate it with an explanation;
  unrelated mutations and paste cannot bypass it through the command palette.
  Idle state contains detached IDs and cached membership masks; navigation and
  drawing perform no patch hashing or tree replay. Source discovery indexes
  shared paths once; preview-only movement leaves selected membership cached.
  Descendant scope traversal visits each node and edge once per walk.
- Copy creates new occurrences without source refs; Move retains the selected
  internal branches and moves their refs with them. Excluded source descendants
  reconnect independently on every affected parent edge, bypassing selected
  commits along their first-parent chains to the nearest unselected ancestor.
  Selected parent edges map to their copied or moved occurrences; parents outside
  selection stay fixed and do not import unrelated side histories. Parent order
  and correspondence remain intact, including ancestry-redundant edges; identical
  resulting IDs are deduplicated only when writing commits.
  Fork leaves destination children and refs unchanged. Insert requires
  one effective leaf and advances applicable destination-tip refs to that leaf.
- Above makes the destination the source root's parent; Insert reconnects its
  former children above the selected leaf. Below uses the destination's parent;
  Insert reconnects only the destination above the leaf and preserves its
  siblings. Below is unavailable at hidden boundaries, parentless commits, or
  merge destinations. Above a hidden boundary adds independent children while
  preserving hidden history and its refs.
- Destinations inside the selection and resulting cycles are rejected before
  publication. Ancestor and excluded-descendant destinations are valid when the
  final graph is acyclic. An unchanged graph/ref result is a no-op. Live AutoMerge
  dependents continue through the existing automatic maintenance.
- Copy implicitly freezes each included AutoMerge into an ordinary merge using
  its recorded tree and ordered parents. Only the copied occurrence is frozen;
  the original remains subscribed to its inputs. Move keeps included AutoMerges
  live with their subscriptions and uses ordinary AutoMerge maintenance, as do
  ordinary rebases. There is no standalone freeze command, editor, action, or shortcut.
  If maintenance collapses a moved AutoMerge onto another result, conflict
  continuations reuse that commit and retain its ref and checkout destinations.
  Consuming the continuation releases all of its retained source refs, including
  external inputs no longer represented by a todo command.
- Freezing requires valid AutoMerge metadata matching its recorded parent slots,
  no muted inputs, and finalized recorded content. The frozen subject becomes
  prose such as `Merge A and B` or `Merge A, B, and C`, omitting generated icons,
  brackets, and pin entries; no remaining labels produces `Merge`. The original
  subject's line ending and every following byte are retained, including CRLF,
  blank lines, and non-UTF-8 body content. Freezing never resolves live input refs
  to regenerate that content.
- Frozen occurrences become ordinary before dependency expansion, including
  placeholders written after an earlier conflict. A plan may contain the live
  original and its frozen copy simultaneously. Copy preserves identity and notes
  without redirecting source refs or subscriptions. Freezing a copy survives
  conflict continuation and undo.
- All selected commits replay eagerly even when HEAD is elsewhere. Pending
  destination ancestors replay in the same transaction before selected commits;
  unrelated affected descendants remain lazy. A pending read-only anchor is
  rejected. Source refs follow moved originals, unreferenced result leaves are
  pinned, and HEAD stays on its logical original or mapped successor. Attachment
  survives when its branch still points there; otherwise HEAD detaches while
  preserving the advanced branch through existing pin rules. Successful UI/CLI
  selection identifies the transplanted root independently of HEAD.
- Final apply opens a fresh repository and revalidates the frozen references,
  source, destination, and HEAD. Loading, planning, and replay run in the progress
  worker, showing **Preparing rebase** before replay starts. The existing executor prepares changes,
  preflights affected worktree/index transitions, and publishes refs atomically.
  Checkout blockers preserve refs and worktrees. Conflicts use the existing
  materialize-or-abort flow; accepted continuations retain eager replay, result
  selection, and an unaffected existing checkout by produced commit ID so todo
  reordering is safe. Dropped commits stop requiring eager replay; a dropped
  result selection falls back to checkout.

### Commit and action shortcuts

- `a` toggles a two-line shortcut group with commit operations above general
  actions. Each action underlines its shortcut letter within its verb, capitalizing
  that letter for Shift bindings, as in `neW-below`, `New-empty`, `Split`, `Fetch`, `Push`,
  `AutoMerge`, `Remerge`, `sTash`, `unsTash`, and `eXclude`. No action label has a
  separate shortcut-letter prefix. The command picker uses the same labels and
  matches them without case sensitivity.
- `a o` rewords, `a w` creates a rebased child, `a Shift-W` inserts below `@`,
  `a Shift-N` creates an empty child, `a e` amends `@`, `a l` spills `@`, `a Shift-S` splits staged from
  unstaged changes, and `a d` deletes a commit when each action is available.
  With a Worktree path selected, `a d` discards that path's changes instead.
  `a b` rebases an eligible hidden base,
  `a u` rebases it onto the newer hidden branch tip when available, `a r` starts
  or finishes a review, `a s` squashes the selected commit, `a Shift-T` stashes or
  restores changes at `@`, and `a h` attaches the remembered branch at detached `HEAD` when available.
  `a Shift-M` creates or extends AutoMerge at HEAD, or adds a selected nonancestor
  commit to HEAD. `a Shift-R` remerges it, `a x` removes
  the selected input from an AutoMerge, and `a Shift-X` removes an input from the
  selected AutoMerge.
- The active branch for network actions is the attached `HEAD` branch, or the
  branch remembered by `refs/worktree/tix/pins/HEAD` while detached.
- `Shift-P` pushes from history or a focused Worktree block without an actions
  prefix; `a Shift-P` also pushes while Tree has focus. An open command popup
  consumes `Shift-P` as query text. Push is available whenever there is an active
  branch and runs `git push <remote> <branch>` for it. The remote follows
  Git's `branch.<name>.pushRemote`, `remote.pushDefault`, then
  `branch.<name>.remote` precedence, falling back to the sole remote, `origin`,
  or the literal `origin` when none is configured. If Git rejects the initial
  push because it requires force, tix offers `<enter>` to retry once with
  `git push --force-with-lease <remote> <branch>`; Escape cancels, and any
  failure of the guarded retry is final.
- Before each push attempt, including a force-with-lease retry, Tix checks the
  visible history of the branch being pushed through every merge parent,
  independently of the current checkout. The active view's hidden tips and all
  their ancestors are excluded, including hidden boundary commits. Showing
  hidden history or having no known hidden tips disables this check completely,
  including its source locks. A retry retains the original view's hidden tips.
  Validation uses native Git's local source ref and the original objects being
  transferred, ignoring replacement objects and ref namespaces. It refuses
  the push and identifies the blocking commit if an ordinary commit still needs
  lazy replay, conflict resolution, merge continuation, or signature finalization.
  AutoMerges count as finalized in any state, including muted inputs and pending
  metadata, but their visible Git parents are still checked. Refusal does not
  replay or otherwise change the local history. Standard ref locks protect the
  source branch and any symbolic referents from validation until Git exits,
  preventing concurrent rewrites from publishing unchecked history. Every exit
  path releases these locks; leaving Tix waits for an active push to finish.
- In blocking-network builds, `a Shift-F` is available whenever a fetch remote
  can be resolved, including at a detached `HEAD` without a remembered branch.
  It runs a gix fetch using the active branch's fetch remote when available,
  then the sole remote or `origin`. It uses that remote's configured fetch
  refspecs and tag policy and permits credential helpers without terminal
  prompting.
- Push, fetch, and picker worktree removal share one user background-task slot.
  Ordinary foreground actions remain available during push and fetch; worktree
  removal blocks exit and worktree switching until deletion finishes. Every task
  uses the existing message area, with completed work in dark gray and the
  remaining background unchanged. Held-command help takes precedence, followed
  by prompts, errors, and other notices; background progress resumes when those
  messages clear, without reserving a separate row. Progress wraps and moves
  above prefix popups like other messages. Fetch's monotonic phases
  allocate 0–5% to setup, 5–10% to connection and authentication, 10–15% to refs
  and negotiation, 15–30% to remote enumeration, counting, and compression,
  30–75% to pack receipt and indexing, 75–90% to delta resolution, and 90–95%
  to index and ref finalization. Completion clears the slot and refreshes
  references. Success uses a green message and failure a red one. Except for
  the rejected-push retry prompt, neither network operation accepts terminal
  input or suspends the TUI.
  Worktree removal maps validation to 0–5%, checkout scanning to 5%, checkout
  deletion to 10–85%, administration scanning to 85%, and administration
  deletion to 90–100%.
- Squash accepts any visible strict ancestor whose affected descendants contain no merges. With one eligible
  target it applies immediately; otherwise navigation is limited to eligible ancestors, `<enter>` confirms,
  and Escape cancels. A non-adjacent source is folded next to the target while intervening commits and sibling
  forks remain above the combined result. Squash uses the history-todo rebase, conflict, and continuation rules.
- Bracketed paste in history trims whitespace and accepts one uniquely
  resolvable hexadecimal commit-ID prefix or one full reverse-hex change ID in
  the Tix view. A copied `commit-hash change-id` pair resolves by its leading
  commit hash and verifies that the full change ID belongs to that commit, so
  siblings remain unambiguous. It copies that single-parent commit above the
  cursor through the shared transplant planner. A hidden boundary is a read-only anchor: its
  existing descendants and refs stay unchanged. An ambiguous change ID switches
  to commit IDs, selects the closest matching sibling, and offers `x` to cycle
  siblings. Invalid or unavailable operands produce an attention message.
- Paste preserves its checkout policy: the copied commit becomes HEAD. Away
  from current HEAD, checkout detaches and retains the departed branch through
  its ordinary HEAD pin. At attached HEAD, only the attached branch advances to
  the copy, including at a hidden anchor. Other refs at the destination stay
  put. Copies retain Git notes and change enrichment but do not duplicate active
  review resources. Paste uses ordinary progress, conflict, continuation, and
  undo handling, and is blocked while a tree selection is active.
- `2` and `@` invoke their time-travel modes directly, outside the group.
  Invoking either leaves an already expanded actions group open.
- After a tap, commit and action shortcuts keep the actions group open.
  Navigation or another recognized command closes it, matching the `v` display shortcut group.
  Plain `r` does not mutate the repository, and plain `t` has no action.
- The footer underlines `a` in `actions`; its expanded commit and action lines
  contain only the operations available for the current selection. An empty
  line says `no actions`.
- The top-level `p`, `v`, `a`, `n`, and `?` keys are reserved for the command
  palette and their groups.
  Pressing a group key while another group is open switches directly to that
  group, and `p` opens the command palette from any group; `? e` cycles the
  changes panes.
- While the `v` group is open, `d`, `i`, `c`, `s`, `e`, `m`, `t`, `r`, and `h`
  control dates, IDs, entry selection, emails, names, mailmap, trailers,
  references, and hidden commits.
- The `n` in `enrich` toggles its shortcut group. On any commit eligible for rewording,
  `n t` toggles `[commit] todo`, preserving a saved note, and `n o` opens
  `[commit] note` in Git's editor as Markdown. Saving or removing a note preserves
  the todo flag, and toggling todo preserves the note. `n e` toggles
  `[tree] checks-pass` for any selected commit, including immutable boundaries.
  `n r` toggles `refackiewed` for the selected patch under the patch-identity
  eligibility rules above, leaving the enrichment group open after a tap.
  `n g` edits the real Git note and remains available when the commit-specific
  Tix actions are not. The group is mutually
  exclusive with the view, commit, actions, and information groups and otherwise follows
  their closing behavior.

## Refresh, focus, and diagnostics

- Native reference watchers observe `HEAD`, loose and packed refs, linked-worktree
  HEAD and membership changes, and the direct or symbolic refs used by view and
  hide revspecs. Linked indexes, logs, locks, and unrelated metadata do not
  trigger history refreshes. Missing refs during an atomic update are transient;
  malformed or inaccessible ordinary refs remain errors.
- The worktrunk picker starts neither reference nor worktree watchers. Promoting
  a worktree to normal full-screen history restores the ordinary watched
  lifecycle.
- Before deleting the previewed worktree, the picker moves to the common
  repository and drops fill and line-diff repositories so redraws cannot reopen
  the disappearing checkout. Success and failure both re-inventory worktrees,
  discard index-keyed worker results and preview caches, and request the selected
  survivor immediately because Git-compatible removal may partly clean up.
- Ref changes that affect view or hidden tips trigger an incremental history
  refresh. Decoration-only changes avoid traversal. Filesystem-driven traversal
  changes, manual refresh, and display toggles preserve selection by commit ID.
  Edits retain the selection on the successor ID returned by the rewrite. A
  selected worktree HEAD or other moving reference follows its changed target,
  covering external branch and StGit patch rewrites. If none remains visible,
  selection falls back to the first selectable row.
- The worktree watcher exists only while the combined worktree block is enabled.
  It observes the index and ignore-aware directories that Git status would walk,
  using non-recursive registrations so ignored build trees do not generate work.
- Access-only and incomplete `.lock` activity are ignored. Completed atomic
  renames, index/HEAD updates, relevant worktree paths, and backend rescan requests
  invalidate the appropriate cache.
- Worktree updates retain the history selection and restore changed-path
  selection by raw path and relative viewport position. They never select the
  newest commit merely because status changed.
- Event batches are bounded and coalesced. Worktree status waits 75 ms of quiet;
  reference transactions wait for their final update. Watchers retry after
  failure while still needed.
- Refresh status remains hidden for 500 ms so quick background work does not
  flicker the footer.
- A filesystem history refresh is presented immediately as one complete frame,
  without animating or retaining intermediate history layouts.
- While the terminal is unfocused, filesystem-attributed redraws replace footer
  separators with persistent orange discs. Focus restores normal separators.
- Subprocess errors with program, exit-status, or captured-output metadata keep
  operation context in their prose without repeating those details. Editor
  commands retain their full configured command when it differs from the
  metadata's program (for example, when a shell launches an editor with arguments).
- Spawned workers inherit the active tracing subscriber and parent span so their
  diagnostics remain connected to the operation that started them.
- Filesystem responses receive correlated IDs in daily tracing logs, including
  semantic trigger, coalesced paths, phases, presentation count, elapsed time,
  and outcome. Logs use the platform application-log directory, retain seven
  days, and are best-effort. Failure to create or open the log is silently
  ignored and never prevents either command-line or interactive operation.
- After every event-loop wait, tix assumes that the original worktree and process
  working directory may have disappeared. Before processing filesystem events or
  redrawing, it lexically normalizes and enters the common repository, reopens it
  as bare, drops worktree state, keeps tree/history views live, and reports recovery
  in the attention notice. Missing administrative `HEAD`, `commondir`, or `gitdir`
  files count as removal even while the checkout and administration directories
  still exist. View loads interrupted between boundary checks retry after recovery;
  late history-worker failures return their graph for a refresh from the common
  repository. A worktree that disappears during picker activation is marked
  unavailable instead of closing the application. Errors unrelated to removal,
  including failures from the surviving common repository, still propagate after
  terminal state is restored.

## Resource and responsiveness invariants

- No `gix::Repository`, commit-graph, object platform, notes platform, or other
  repository-owning value may remain in idle application/event-loop state,
  except line-diff worker repositories during their bounded ten-second reuse
  window.
- Hidden-revision startup validation returns only detached revision and warning
  data; its temporary repository is dropped before terminal initialization and
  the event loop.
- View population opens a fresh non-isolated repository so mailmap, notes, diff
  drivers, pagers, signing, and other Git configuration are current. It starts
  without an object cache; bounded diff operations may enable one temporarily and
  disable it again before any navigation reuse. Detached display data is retained.
- One fill repository may be shared by commit, tree, worktree, and metadata loads
  during continuous key-repeat or mouse navigation. It is dropped after the
  75 ms idle boundary.
- Patch-enrichment population reads only commit metadata and notes for visible
  rows. Patch identities are calculated during explicit mutation, never during
  display population or by an idle worker.
- Terminal growth loads metadata for every newly visible history row before that
  frame is painted; unloaded placeholder dates or titles are never shown.
- Traversal and incremental refresh workers may use a bounded object cache and
  must drop their repository when finished. Lane and verification workers exist
  only for active work. Line-diff workers may remain for ten seconds after their
  latest batch, then are joined together and release their shared repository
  resources.
- Worktrunk graph population is serialized, prioritizes the latest selection,
  and may retain useful detached data from obsolete results, but an obsolete
  result must never replace the selected preview or delay further list input.
- Change IDs are scanned only while configured hidden tips are actively excluded.
  Unrestricted and explicitly expanded views perform no scan. A refresh keeps
  the current projection's IDs until it has synchronously scanned the replacement,
  then publishes rows, IDs, duplicate markers, and gutter width together.
- Redraw is reactive and capped at approximately 60 frames per second while
  streaming. Mouse events are drained and coalesced in bounded batches so input
  storms cannot starve the main loop.
- Main status remains readable regardless of pane focus. Errors are surfaced in
  the nearest relevant status line; diagnostics never replace user-visible
  errors.
- Global command and recovery feedback uses one transient notice channel in the
  history and ref-tree views. It reserves a wrapped, content-height block above
  worktree changes until the next recognized user action, inset by two columns
  within that pane when visible and otherwise within the main view. It never
  covers the main or pane-local status lines. Green indicates success, yellow
  indicates attention, no-op, recovery, partial success, or an armed prompt, and
  red indicates failure. While undo or redo feedback retains its queue position,
  the notice becomes a two-tone progress bar: the applied share is bright on the
  left and the redo share is dim on the right. A fully applied queue is entirely
  bright, while its start and an empty queue are entirely dim; attention and
  failure notices retain the same progress in their respective hues. Delete,
  review selection and recovery, suspended
  conflicts, and paused rebases retain their notice until resolved; pane-specific
  errors remain in their pane status line.
- Closing the new-commit editor without changing its prepared buffer leaves the
  repository untouched and reports `no commit created: no input was provided`.

## Regression coverage

- Unit tests cover navigation, projections, pane layout, status summaries,
  selection restoration, watcher classification, cached graph walks, diff
  preparation, signatures, rewording, and terminal rendering.
- Behavior changes to this specification require corresponding tests and an
  update to this document in the same semantic patch.
